                        "[S1915M] Established restrained, security\u2011focused understandings with England, France, Austria, Russia, and Turkey. England: maritime understanding \u2014 F KIE will hold/avoid DEN/HOL if England refrains from supporting moves against KIE/BER; England will keep North Sea reserves. France: tentative non\u2011aggression \u2014 Germany will hold BER/MUN and avoid pushing into BUR/SIL if France keeps F BRE/PAR/MAR and signals not to contest Kiel; France asked for concrete support if it commits north. Austria: pledge to hold VIE/BUD and stabilise the Balkans while Germany refrains from moves into BOH/TYR and keeps MUN/BER defensive; mutual aid notifications agreed. Russia: limited information sharing and notification of moves toward PRU/BOH; Germany will not move into PRU/SIL absent clear Russian aggression. Turkey: Germany will not interfere in Aegean/Anatolian operations if Turkey avoids aggression toward Bulgaria/Adriatic that would threaten Austria. All understandings framed by forecasts warning of a 60% chance of near\u2011term aggression toward Austria (forecast_coalition_p) and a separate ~60% England\u2192France overreach risk, so commitments are conditional and aimed at reducing two\u2011front escalation risk.\nIntent: S1915M orders intent: F KIE \u2014 HOLD (commitment to England). A BER \u2014 HOLD/DEFEND (no moves into BUR or toward France). A MUN \u2014 HOLD/READY (available to cover Austria if Russia advances; no move into BOH/PRU/SIL this turn). Maintain defensive posture that signals non\u2011aggression to France and Austria while preserving flexibility for rapid support if forecasts materialize. I intend to fulfill these commitments to maintain credibility; if any partner violates agreed constraints (notably aggression vs Austria or a supported assault on KIE/BER), I will immediately reassign A MUN to either BOH or PRU in response next phase. I will also send secure notification to Austria, Russia, and Turkey of these exact orders so future self remembers the conditional commitments.",

Austria and Turkey held; Russia made no aggressive moves into PRU/BOH/SIL. France repositioned MAO\u2192BRE and PAR\u2192PIC and MAR\u2192SPA (pressing into Iberia), signaling westward focus rather than contesting Kiel. No surprises or unexpected attacks.\n\nImplications: my conditional commitments reduced immediate two\u2011front risk \u2014 forecast_coalition_p (60% near\u2011term aggression to Austria) did not materialize this turn, lowering urgency but not eliminating risk. Trustworthiness: England and Austria strengthened credibility; France appears non\u2011aggressive toward KIE for now but remains opportunistic (westward pressure). Russia remains noncommittal; continue treating it as medium risk.\n\nLessons: maintain visible, verifiable holds to preserve credibility. Continue secure notifications to Austria/Russia/Turkey and prepare contingency to move A MUN to BOH/PRU if any violation occurs.",

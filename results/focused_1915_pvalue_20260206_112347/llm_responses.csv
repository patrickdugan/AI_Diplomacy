SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

Forecast note: intelligence (forecast_coalition_p) indicates a 60% probability that a named rival will act aggressively next phase; this raises the near-term risk to our shared eastern flank and argues for a binding, defensive posture between us. I propose the following immediate understandings: (1) You hold VIE and BUD; I will keep MUN and BER secure — no surprise attacks on each other. (2) You commit your forces to stabilise the Balkans; I will refrain from moves into BOH or TYR this phase and instead keep MUN available to support or cover your eastern flank if Russia presses (I estimate a >=50% chance Russia advances through BOH/PRU corridors). (3) We exchange notifications of any third‑party negotiations and agree rapid mutual aid if England or Russia opens aggression. If you accept, reply with confirmation and any unit moves you need covered. This coordination secures our centers and reduces two‑front risk — I expect it will increase our combined survival probability by a meaningful margin.""

Proposal: a simple maritime understanding for the coming season — my Kiel fleet will avoid aggressive moves into DEN/HOL provided your armies do not threaten KIE or BER. This preserves status quo and lets both of us secure home centers. Note on forecasts: our shared artifact indicates increased probability (60%) of a named rival acting aggressively next phase; this makes predictability between us valuable. Please confirm you will not support any move against KIE or BER this turn and I will order F KIE to hold or shift to BAL only with prior notice.""

I propose a temporary non‑aggression and communication channel: you maintain F BRE/PAR/MAR; I will hold MUN/BER and not push into BUR or SIL this season. If you are willing, we can coordinate to prevent England from exploiting any sudden gains — I assess at least a 40% chance England will attempt opportunistic expansion in the low countries if France weakens.

I intend to keep MUN and BER as secure pivots; I will not move into PRU or SIL this phase absent clear Russian aggression. However, an allied Austria is likely to face aggression (forecast_coalition_p places 60% probability of aggression toward Austria next phase), which could cascade into our border. To reduce chance of miscalculation, I propose mutual notification of any moves toward PRU/BOH and limited information sharing for one season. This lowers the chance of accidental two‑front escalation — I estimate it reduces eastern conflict probability by ~20%. Please state whether you accept.""

Given current forecasts (see message to Austria), an aggressive action against Austria is moderately likely (60%); avoiding such actions will help keep Central Europe intact. If you accept, I will order MUN to remain defensive and be ready to support Austria diplomatically.""

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

No urgent messages requiring direct responses.

**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: England proposes a limited western armistice to stabilize sea lanes while the continent sorts itself. I will not contest Brest this spring if France refrains from hostile moves toward Belgium, Holland, or the Channel coast. Forecast note: per a recent artifact assessing French reactions to concessions (target: France, confidence 0.6), there is a 62% chance a low-risk concession invites over-commitment; accordingly I will maintain reserves in North Sea approaches and the Low Countries while testing restraint. My aim is to preserve balance and prevent any single land power from breaking out.
 FRANCE: To all powers: England holds 10 and sits on my Spanish coast. A stable balance requires Iberia not be a permanent English bastion. I seek coordinated pressure that reopens Belgium/Spain and checks a Channel surge without handing Germany an easy rebound. I can pivot north or south this spring; if I see concrete support to contest Spain/Portugal or Belgium, I’ll commit my fleet to ENG/MAO accordingly.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: From the North Sea: I plan to hold the western lanes steady and avoid entanglement in the Balkans this spring. If Turkey presses you hard, I can pressure France/Germany to keep your north flank clear by threatening Kiel should they meddle south. If Russia gains too freely in RUM/SEV, I’ll encourage a counterweight rather than a Russian breakout to the north. Forecast signal I’m watching: a 62% chance France over-extends if given leeway; if that happens, I will pin them in the west, freeing you from western interference.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: England’s growth opens you to northern spillover if Germany collapses. I propose a quiet understanding: I contain England in the west while you keep Italy honest. If I demonstrate anti-English orders (BRE–ENG or –MAO; PAR–PIC), can you nudge VEN to watch WMS rather than Tyrolia/Burgundy? STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT implication: The forecast_false_concession_p artifact targets Austria and estimates a 0.62 probability that offering you a low-risk concession induces over-commitment; I’m therefore offering transparency instead of a trap—no Burg incursion if VEN doesn’t poke PIE/TYR. Forecast implication: if you overextend west, you risk English opportunism via North Sea–Denmark this year.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Austria — this is Germany. We have no hostility between us and should coordinate tightly given the present pressures. Forecast note: intelligence (forecast_coalition_p) indicates a 60% probability that a named rival will act aggressively next phase; this raises the near-term risk to our shared eastern flank and argues for a binding, defensive posture between us. I propose the following immediate understandings: (1) You hold VIE and BUD; I will keep MUN and BER secure — no surprise attacks on each other. (2) You commit your forces to stabilise the Balkans; I will refrain from moves into BOH or TYR this phase and instead keep MUN available to support or cover your eastern flank if Russia presses (I estimate a >=50% chance Russia advances through BOH/PRU corridors). (3) We exchange notifications of any third‑party negotiations and agree rapid mutual aid if England or Russia opens aggression. If you accept, reply with confirmation and any unit moves you need covered. This coordination secures our centers and reduces two‑front risk — I expect it will increase our combined survival probability by a meaningful margin.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: You don’t want an English Gibraltar. If I move MAR–PIE and BRE–MAO, can you pressure WMS/NAf to make POR/SPA untenable for England? I’ll avoid ENG if you help me retake SPA this year (MAR–SPA with your tacit non-interference in PIE, then WMS cuts MAO support). If England vacates, we stabilize; if he refuses, we form a short-term Iberian pact to roll him back. Your upside: leverage in the Med without gifting Austria/Turkey tempo.

  FRANCE: If England keeps Iberia, your north stays pinned. I can push ENG/MAO to cut English supports while you press Nwy/Den leverage. If I move BRE–ENG and PAR–PIC, can you posture STP(SC)–BAR/GoB to threaten Nwy? Even a feint raises England’s defensive cost by 1–2 units. I’ll signal intent with BRE off the French coast this spring; a synchronized demonstration lifts both our odds of survival by ~30% versus piecemeal plays.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Russia — Germany. The eastern situation is volatile and forecasted risks are non‑trivial. I intend to keep MUN and BER as secure pivots; I will not move into PRU or SIL this phase absent clear Russian aggression. However, an allied Austria is likely to face aggression (forecast_coalition_p places 60% probability of aggression toward Austria next phase), which could cascade into our border. To reduce chance of miscalculation, I propose mutual notification of any moves toward PRU/BOH and limited information sharing for one season. This lowers the chance of accidental two‑front escalation — I estimate it reduces eastern conflict probability by ~20%. Please state whether you accept.

Messages This Round:
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: England proposes a limited western armistice to stabilize sea lanes while the continent sorts itself. I will not contest Brest this spring if France refrains from hostile moves toward Belgium, Holland, or the Channel coast. Forecast note: per a recent artifact assessing French reactions to concessions (target: France, confidence 0.6), there is a 62% chance a low-risk concession invites over-commitment; accordingly I will maintain reserves in North Sea approaches and the Low Countries while testing restraint. My aim is to preserve balance and prevent any single land power from breaking out.
 FRANCE: To all powers: England holds 10 and sits on my Spanish coast. A stable balance requires Iberia not be a permanent English bastion. I seek coordinated pressure that reopens Belgium/Spain and checks a Channel surge without handing Germany an easy rebound. I can pivot north or south this spring; if I see concrete support to contest Spain/Portugal or Belgium, I’ll commit my fleet to ENG/MAO accordingly.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: England will not interfere in the Black Sea theatre this spring. I’m watching for a western overreach by France (62% likelihood per a forecasting artifact), in which case I’ll fix them in place and keep Germany honest around Kiel. If Russia pushes north from STP/SC toward Norway or Finland, I will respond by hardening Scandinavia, not by aiding a northern Russian breakout. If you keep your fleets focused east and avoid any foray into the western Med that threatens Iberia, I can assure you no English pressure against you this season.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: Your win path improves if England is checked before he converts Iberia into a naval springboard to the Mid. I can commit BRE–MAO and ask Italy to face west; in return, a little diplomatic pressure on Italy to avoid Tyrolia/GoL frees me to fight England. If I show MAO/PIE pressure, can you hint to Italy that Balkans friction returns if he aids England in WMS? Small signals from you now can prevent an English fleet cascade later.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Turkey — Germany. The Balkans and Black Sea are burning; stability there matters to us both. I propose Germany will not interfere with your operations in the Aegean/Anatolian coasts provided you do not attempt moves into Bulgaria or the Adriatic that threaten Austria or Italy. Given current forecasts (see message to Austria), an aggressive action against Austria is moderately likely (60%); avoiding such actions will help keep Central Europe intact. If you accept, I will order MUN to remain defensive and be ready to support Austria diplomatically.

I can pivot north or south this spring; if I see concrete support to contest Spain/Portugal or Belgium, I’ll commit my fleet to ENG/MAO accordingly.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ENGLAND: Quiet word from across the water. I am prepared to leave Brest untouched this spring if you keep PAR-MAR-BRE focused defensively and avoid any thrusts at BEL/HOL or the Channel coast. In return, I will keep Belgium/Holland steady and not push PIC/GAS. The point is safe lanes and time—no rush for either of us to bleed. Forecast implication (artifact tags you as the target, confidence 0.6): there’s a 62% risk that a concession tempts over-commitment; I’m therefore keeping modest cover in the North Sea approaches. If you show restraint now, I can shift attention east and consider coordinated pressure on Kiel later. If you reach for PIC/GAS or BUR, I will answer firmly. Your call.
  FRANCE: We both know your tenth center is built on Iberian sand. If I throw BRE to ENG and PAR to PIC/GAS, I can either block you or enable you; your call depends on whether you want a quick, low-friction path to 12 via Belgium/Munich turbulence, or a costly slog in Iberia that invites a continental coalition. Offer: You vacate SPA to MAO this spring while I walk MAR–SPA; in exchange I avoid ENG and keep BRE–MAO to help you pressure POR or the Mid. You get tempo east without a Western quagmire, and I live. If you decline and hold SPA, I’m 90% to order F BRE–ENG with army pressure on GAS/PIE to pull Italy and Germany into a stop-the-leader. Choose efficiency over hubris.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  ENGLAND: I can offer you a narrow corridor to breathe if you keep KIE strictly defensive. Proposal: you hold in Kiel; I refrain from a supported assault this spring. In return, you angle BER/MUN south to check Austrian/Italian maneuvering, and you avoid any support to Russian gains in the north. If France breaks toward PIC/GAS, I will pivot to the Channel and leave you space around Kiel. Forecast note: my read is that a concession to France has a 62% chance to lure them into overreach—if they do, I’d coordinate an immediate tap on PIC/BRE while keeping the North Sea lanes secure. Confirm KIE H and no support to STP, and we’re aligned.
  GERMANY: England — Germany here. We face a dangerous European balance with your naval dominance evident. I wish to avoid inadvertent escalation in the North/Heligoland area. Proposal: a simple maritime understanding for the coming season — my Kiel fleet will avoid aggressive moves into DEN/HOL provided your armies do not threaten KIE or BER. This preserves status quo and lets both of us secure home centers. Note on forecasts: our shared artifact indicates increased probability (60%) of a named rival acting aggressively next phase; this makes predictability between us valuable. Please confirm you will not support any move against KIE or BER this turn and I will order F KIE to hold or shift to BAL only with prior notice.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  ENGLAND: I intend to keep Scandinavia quiet if you keep STP/SC from probing Norway or Finland. You hold STP; I hold NWY/SWE/DEN without advances on Finland or STP. If Germany wobbles, I will look at Kiel rather than your north. Should France lunge west despite my concession, I’ll reweight to the Channel and leave your northern coast undisturbed. Forecast implication: artifact suggests a 62% chance France over-commits if given slack; if that triggers, I won’t join a northern dogpile on you—my priority will be maritime containment in the Channel.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  ENGLAND: From the North Sea: I plan to hold the western lanes steady and avoid entanglement in the Balkans this spring. If Turkey presses you hard, I can pressure France/Germany to keep your north flank clear by threatening Kiel should they meddle south. If Russia gains too freely in RUM/SEV, I’ll encourage a counterweight rather than a Russian breakout to the north. Forecast signal I’m watching: a 62% chance France over-extends if given leeway; if that happens, I will pin them in the west, freeing you from western interference.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  ENGLAND: I’ll keep Iberia calm and the western seas orderly this spring. If France surges into GAS/PIC, I shall answer at once, thereby reducing pressure on your MAR/VEN axis. If you’re pressing Austria or Turkey, note that I aim to keep Germany contained at Kiel rather than open a northern front for Russia. Forecast note: there’s a 62% chance France over-commits when offered slack; if that fires, I’ll clamp the Channel and you may find MAR less contested. Share your intentions for MAR/NAP so I can time any Channel pressure precisely.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  ENGLAND: England will not interfere in the Black Sea theatre this spring. I’m watching for a western overreach by France (62% likelihood per a forecasting artifact), in which case I’ll fix them in place and keep Germany honest around Kiel. If Russia pushes north from STP/SC toward Norway or Finland, I will respond by hardening Scandinavia, not by aiding a northern Russian breakout.

**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: England proposes a limited western armistice to stabilize sea lanes while the continent sorts itself. I will not contest Brest this spring if France refrains from hostile moves toward Belgium, Holland, or the Channel coast. Forecast note: per a recent artifact assessing French reactions to concessions (target: France, confidence 0.6), there is a 62% chance a low-risk concession invites over-commitment; accordingly I will maintain reserves in North Sea approaches and the Low Countries while testing restraint. My aim is to preserve balance and prevent any single land power from breaking out.
 FRANCE: To all powers: England holds 10 and sits on my Spanish coast. A stable balance requires Iberia not be a permanent English bastion. I seek coordinated pressure that reopens Belgium/Spain and checks a Channel surge without handing Germany an easy rebound. I can pivot north or south this spring; if I see concrete support to contest Spain/Portugal or Belgium, I’ll commit my fleet to ENG/MAO accordingly.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: I can offer you a narrow corridor to breathe if you keep KIE strictly defensive. Proposal: you hold in Kiel; I refrain from a supported assault this spring. In return, you angle BER/MUN south to check Austrian/Italian maneuvering, and you avoid any support to Russian gains in the north. If France breaks toward PIC/GAS, I will pivot to the Channel and leave you space around Kiel. Forecast note: my read is that a concession to France has a 62% chance to lure them into overreach—if they do, I’d coordinate an immediate tap on PIC/BRE while keeping the North Sea lanes secure. Confirm KIE H and no support to STP, and we’re aligned.
  GERMANY: England — Germany here. We face a dangerous European balance with your naval dominance evident. I wish to avoid inadvertent escalation in the North/Heligoland area. Proposal: a simple maritime understanding for the coming season — my Kiel fleet will avoid aggressive moves into DEN/HOL provided your armies do not threaten KIE or BER. This preserves status quo and lets both of us secure home centers. Note on forecasts: our shared artifact indicates increased probability (60%) of a named rival acting aggressively next phase; this makes predictability between us valuable. Please confirm you will not support any move against KIE or BER this turn and I will order F KIE to hold or shift to BAL only with prior notice.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: England at 10 is your existential problem. I can put F BRE–ENG or –MAO this spring. If you commit A BER–KIE/MUN–BUR defense while hinting BEL pressure (HOL–BEL S by DEN?), I’ll aim north: PAR–PIC, BRE–ENG to cut English support, and MAR–BUR to screen Munich. If you instead turtle, I’ll pivot south and let England keep Belgium uncontested. Give me one concrete piece—support against BEL or a promise to cover MUN if I occupy BUR—and I’ll commit to anti-English moves this phase.
  GERMANY: France — Germany. You are under severe pressure; a stable western front matters to European order and to Germany’s need to avoid overextension. I propose a temporary non‑aggression and communication channel: you maintain F BRE/PAR/MAR; I will hold MUN/BER and not push into BUR or SIL this season. If you are willing, we can coordinate to prevent England from exploiting any sudden gains — I assess at least a 40% chance England will attempt opportunistic expansion in the low countries if France weakens. Reply if you accept and state any urgent unit needs.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  GERMANY: Austria — this is Germany. We have no hostility between us and should coordinate tightly given the present pressures. Forecast note: intelligence (forecast_coalition_p) indicates a 60% probability that a named rival will act aggressively next phase; this raises the near-term risk to our shared eastern flank and argues for a binding, defensive posture between us. I propose the following immediate understandings: (1) You hold VIE and BUD; I will keep MUN and BER secure — no surprise attacks on each other. (2) You commit your forces to stabilise the Balkans; I will refrain from moves into BOH or TYR this phase and instead keep MUN available to support or cover your eastern flank if Russia presses (I estimate a >=50% chance Russia advances through BOH/PRU corridors). (3) We exchange notifications of any third‑party negotiations and agree rapid mutual aid if England or Russia opens aggression. If you accept, reply with confirmation and any unit moves you need covered. This coordination secures our centers and reduces two‑front risk — I expect it will increase our combined survival probability by a meaningful margin.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  GERMANY: Russia — Germany. The eastern situation is volatile and forecasted risks are non‑trivial. I intend to keep MUN and BER as secure pivots; I will not move into PRU or SIL this phase absent clear Russian aggression. However, an allied Austria is likely to face aggression (forecast_coalition_p places 60% probability of aggression toward Austria next phase), which could cascade into our border. To reduce chance of miscalculation, I propose mutual notification of any moves toward PRU/BOH and limited information sharing for one season. This lowers the chance of accidental two‑front escalation — I estimate it reduces eastern conflict probability by ~20%. Please state whether you accept.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  GERMANY: Turkey — Germany. The Balkans and Black Sea are burning; stability there matters to us both. I propose Germany will not interfere with your operations in the Aegean/Anatolian coasts provided you do not attempt moves into Bulgaria or the Adriatic that threaten Austria or Italy. Given current forecasts (see message to Austria), an aggressive action against Austria is moderately likely (60%); avoiding such actions will help keep Central Europe intact. If you accept, I will order MUN to remain defensive and be ready to support Austria diplomatically.

The England→France forecast (not formally within the storyworld_id but present in messages) with ~0.62 likelihood of overreach justifies the KIE hold: an observable defensive posture in Kiel increases deterrence and reduces the chance England or France exploit a perceived German passivity.

Messages This Round:
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: England proposes a limited western armistice to stabilize sea lanes while the continent sorts itself. I will not contest Brest this spring if France refrains from hostile moves toward Belgium, Holland, or the Channel coast. Forecast note: per a recent artifact assessing French reactions to concessions (target: France, confidence 0.6), there is a 62% chance a low-risk concession invites over-commitment; accordingly I will maintain reserves in North Sea approaches and the Low Countries while testing restraint. My aim is to preserve balance and prevent any single land power from breaking out.
 FRANCE: To all powers: England holds 10 and sits on my Spanish coast. A stable balance requires Iberia not be a permanent English bastion. I seek coordinated pressure that reopens Belgium/Spain and checks a Channel surge without handing Germany an easy rebound. I can pivot north or south this spring; if I see concrete support to contest Spain/Portugal or Belgium, I’ll commit my fleet to ENG/MAO accordingly.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Quiet word from across the water. I am prepared to leave Brest untouched this spring if you keep PAR-MAR-BRE focused defensively and avoid any thrusts at BEL/HOL or the Channel coast. In return, I will keep Belgium/Holland steady and not push PIC/GAS. The point is safe lanes and time—no rush for either of us to bleed. Forecast implication (artifact tags you as the target, confidence 0.6): there’s a 62% risk that a concession tempts over-commitment; I’m therefore keeping modest cover in the North Sea approaches. If you show restraint now, I can shift attention east and consider coordinated pressure on Kiel later. If you reach for PIC/GAS or BUR, I will answer firmly. Your call.
  FRANCE: We both know your tenth center is built on Iberian sand. If I throw BRE to ENG and PAR to PIC/GAS, I can either block you or enable you; your call depends on whether you want a quick, low-friction path to 12 via Belgium/Munich turbulence, or a costly slog in Iberia that invites a continental coalition. Offer: You vacate SPA to MAO this spring while I walk MAR–SPA; in exchange I avoid ENG and keep BRE–MAO to help you pressure POR or the Mid. You get tempo east without a Western quagmire, and I live. If you decline and hold SPA, I’m 90% to order F BRE–ENG with army pressure on GAS/PIE to pull Italy and Germany into a stop-the-leader. Choose efficiency over hubris.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  FRANCE: England at 10 is your existential problem. I can put F BRE–ENG or –MAO this spring. If you commit A BER–KIE/MUN–BUR defense while hinting BEL pressure (HOL–BEL S by DEN?), I’ll aim north: PAR–PIC, BRE–ENG to cut English support, and MAR–BUR to screen Munich. If you instead turtle, I’ll pivot south and let England keep Belgium uncontested. Give me one concrete piece—support against BEL or a promise to cover MUN if I occupy BUR—and I’ll commit to anti-English moves this phase.
  GERMANY: France — Germany. You are under severe pressure; a stable western front matters to European order and to Germany’s need to avoid overextension. I propose a temporary non‑aggression and communication channel: you maintain F BRE/PAR/MAR; I will hold MUN/BER and not push into BUR or SIL this season. If you are willing, we can coordinate to prevent England from exploiting any sudden gains — I assess at least a 40% chance England will attempt opportunistic expansion in the low countries if France weakens. Reply if you accept and state any urgent unit needs.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  FRANCE: You don’t want an English Gibraltar. If I move MAR–PIE and BRE–MAO, can you pressure WMS/NAf to make POR/SPA untenable for England? I’ll avoid ENG if you help me retake SPA this year (MAR–SPA with your tacit non-interference in PIE, then WMS cuts MAO support). If England vacates, we stabilize; if he refuses, we form a short-term Iberian pact to roll him back. Your upside: leverage in the Med without gifting Austria/Turkey tempo.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  FRANCE: England’s growth opens you to northern spillover if Germany collapses. I propose a quiet understanding: I contain England in the west while you keep Italy honest. If I demonstrate anti-English orders (BRE–ENG or –MAO; PAR–PIC), can you nudge VEN to watch WMS rather than Tyrolia/Burgundy? STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT implication: The forecast_false_concession_p artifact targets Austria and estimates a 0.62 probability that offering you a low-risk concession induces over-commitment; I’m therefore offering transparency instead of a trap—no Burg incursion if VEN doesn’t poke PIE/TYR. Forecast implication: if you overextend west, you risk English opportunism via North Sea–Denmark this year.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  FRANCE: If England keeps Iberia, your north stays pinned. I can push ENG/MAO to cut English supports while you press Nwy/Den leverage. If I move BRE–ENG and PAR–PIC, can you posture STP(SC)–BAR/GoB to threaten Nwy? Even a feint raises England’s defensive cost by 1–2 units. I’ll signal intent with BRE off the French coast this spring; a synchronized demonstration lifts both our odds of survival by ~30% versus piecemeal plays.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  FRANCE: Your win path improves if England is checked before he converts Iberia into a naval springboard to the Mid. I can commit BRE–MAO and ask Italy to face west; in return, a little diplomatic pressure on Italy to avoid Tyrolia/GoL frees me to fight England. If I show MAO/PIE pressure, can you hint to Italy that Balkans friction returns if he aids England in WMS? Small signals from you now can prevent an English fleet cascade later.

Maintain BUR neutrality this spring to avoid provoking Germany unless Germany explicitly promises MUN cover; if Germany offers MUN cover or BEL play late, upgrade MAR–BUR instead of MAR–SPA.

  ""storyworld_implications"": ""STORYWORLD_FORECAST_REFERENCE 'forecast_false_concession_p' (target: Austria) implies a 0.62 chance a low-risk concession elicits overreach. I therefore used transparency with Austria (promise no BUR if VEN avoids PIE/TYR) to prevent triggering that aggression bait, keeping Austria calm and Italy pointed west. England's own citation of a similar 62% risk of French over-commitment means he will keep cover in the North Sea/Low Countries; expect him to hedge while testing my restraint. This supports a MAO pivot over immediate ENG, as it strains Iberia without triggering England’s reserved counter in the Channel. Coalition messaging to Italy/Russia must reference Iberian leverage and North Sea pin to justify their participation."",
  ""forecasting_rationale"": ""Referencing 'forecast_false_concession_p': since the artifact predicts 0.62 probability that Austria over-commits when granted a concession, I avoided dangling a tempting western opening (e.g., empty BUR/PIE) that could pull Austria/Italy into Tyrolia/Burgundy. Instead, I offered a clear non-incursion pledge to dampen that aggression, preserving my flank. England also invoked a 62% risk of French over-commitment after concessions; thus, I forecast he keeps NS/Low Countries cover regardless of words. That reduces the EV of F BRE–ENG this spring and increases the EV of F BRE–MAO plus A MAR–SPA, which pressures Iberia (England’s soft underbelly) while avoiding a costly Channel brawl against prepared defenses. The forecast therefore shifted my intent from Channel contest to MAO/Iberian leverage and shaped my diplomatic framing to Italy/Russia to amplify that pressure.""

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[S1915M] Established restrained, security‑focused understandings with England, France, Austria, Russia, and Turkey. England: maritime understanding — F KIE will hold/avoid DEN/HOL if England refrains from supporting moves against KIE/BER; England will keep North Sea reserves. France: tentative non‑aggression — Germany will hold BER/MUN and avoid pushing into BUR/SIL if France keeps F BRE/PAR/MAR and signals not to contest Kiel; France asked for concrete support if it commits north. Austria: pledge to hold VIE/BUD and stabilise the Balkans while Germany refrains from moves into BOH/TYR and keeps MUN/BER defensive; mutual aid notifications agreed. Russia: limited information sharing and notification of moves toward PRU/BOH; Germany will not move into PRU/SIL absent clear Russian aggression. Turkey: Germany will not interfere in Aegean/Anatolian operations if Turkey avoids aggression toward Bulgaria/Adriatic that would threaten Austria. All understandings framed by forecasts warning of a 60% chance of near‑term aggression toward Austria (forecast_coalition_p) and a separate ~60% England→France overreach risk, so commitments are conditional and aimed at reducing two‑front escalation risk.
Intent: S1915M orders intent: F KIE — HOLD (commitment to England). A BER — HOLD/DEFEND (no moves into BUR or toward France). A MUN — HOLD/READY (available to cover Austria if Russia advances; no move into BOH/PRU/SIL this turn). Maintain defensive posture that signals non‑aggression to France and Austria while preserving flexibility for rapid support if forecasts materialize. I intend to fulfill these commitments to maintain credibility; if any partner violates agreed constraints (notably aggression vs Austria or a supported assault on KIE/BER), I will immediately reassign A MUN to either BOH or PRU in response next phase. I will also send secure notification to Austria, Russia, and Turkey of these exact orders so future self remembers the conditional commitments.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Output Moves in JSON (first)
  - return an order for each of your units.
2. Reason (brief)
  - 1-2 sentences max.

Current Goals:
- Deny England consolidation of Iberia and prevent an English naval cascade into the Mid
- Regain or at least contest Spain/Portugal without exposing Burgundy/Munich
- Keep Germany stable while extracting anti-English coordination or at minimum non-aggression in BUR
- Forge a temporary FR-IT-RU pressure net that raises England's defensive costs in MAO/ENG/North
- Avoid Channel overcommitment; preserve French survival and rebuild prospects

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[S1915M] England offered a limited western armistice and not to hit Brest if I avoid ENG/Low Countries pushes; he flagged a 62% risk I would over‑commit after a concession and will keep cover. I countered: England vacates Spain to MAO while I take MAR–SPA and keep BRE–MAO to help pressure POR/Mid; if he refuses, I threatened F BRE–ENG with PAR–PIC and MAR pressure to rally Germany/Italy. Germany proposed general non‑aggression and turtling without concrete help; I asked for either support vs BEL or cover for MUN if I take BUR. Italy was asked to coordinate Iberian rollback (WMS/NAf pressure) if I go MAO/PIE; Austria was asked to keep Italy honest with a pledge I won’t enter BUR if VEN stays off PIE/TYR; Russia was asked to feint at Nwy to raise English defensive costs; Turkey was nudged to dissuade Italy from aiding England in WMS. No firm English acceptance yet; no concrete German support secured. Coalition signals pending.
Intent: Primary plan: anti-English posture without overcommitting in the Channel. Orders: F BRE–MAO (contest Iberia, enable Mid pressure), A PAR–PIC (screen Channel coast and signal anti-ENG), A MAR–SPA (walk-in if ENG vacates; otherwise contest). No entry to ENG this turn unless England blatantly holds SPA and masses fleets north; only then consider F BRE–ENG, but current intent is MAO. Maintain BUR neutrality this spring to avoid provoking Germany unless Germany explicitly promises MUN cover; if Germany offers MUN cover or BEL play late, upgrade MAR–BUR instead of MAR–SPA. Coordinate diplomatically with Italy for WMS pressure and with Russia for Nwy feints. Fulfilment: I will honour promises not to strike BUR this season if Austria/Italy refrain from PIE/TYR; I will not attack Belgium this move.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[S1915M] West: I offered France a limited armistice (no hit on Brest if they avoid Channel/Low Countries). France countered: I vacate SPA to MAO so they take MAR–SPA; they’d avoid ENG and use BRE–MAO to help vs POR/Mid. They threatened ENG/GAS/BUR pressure if I refuse. Germany proposed status quo: F KIE holds/only BAL with notice; I not support attacks on KIE/BER; I proposed KIE H and no northern Russian supports. Russia: mutual quiet in Scandinavia; I won’t press STP if they don’t probe NWY/Fin. Others received assurances I’d stabilize west and contain Kiel; all were told I expect a 62% chance France over-commits if given slack and I’ll clamp the Channel if so.
Intent: Maintain western naval leverage while testing French restraint without yielding Iberia. Orders intent: hold/cover North Sea approaches (NTH/HEL/ENG coverage via adjacent armies/fleets), keep Belgium/Holland secure (A BEL/HOL H), keep Scandinavia quiet (A NWY/SWE/DEN H), do not attack Brest this spring, do not support on KIE or BER this turn, keep pressure option on KIE via adjacency but no execution, do not vacate SPA (decline French MAR–SPA swap), keep POR and SPA held, maintain A EDI/LON/LVP as Channel/North Sea reserves. Fulfilments: honour no-attack on KIE/BER and no move on Brest; honour quiet with Russia in the north; do not enter ENG unless France lunges into PIC/GAS/BUR or F BRE–ENG appears, in which case immediate clamp: cover ENG/NTH and tap PIC/BRE if feasible.

Reasoning:
We hold the North Sea approaches and Low Countries, honor quiet with Germany/Russia, and avoid Brest while denying France an easy MAR–SPA swap by advancing SPA to GAS as a screen. This preserves naval leverage and timing to punish any French overreach without provoking a northern coalition.","Success"

[S1915M] Established restrained, security‑focused understandings with England, France, Austria, Russia, and Turkey. England: maritime understanding — F KIE will hold/avoid DEN/HOL if England refrains from supporting moves against KIE/BER; England will keep North Sea reserves. France: tentative non‑aggression — Germany will hold BER/MUN and avoid pushing into BUR/SIL if France keeps F BRE/PAR/MAR and signals not to contest Kiel; France asked for concrete support if it commits north. Austria: pledge to hold VIE/BUD and stabilise the Balkans while Germany refrains from moves into BOH/TYR and keeps MUN/BER defensive; mutual aid notifications agreed. Russia: limited information sharing and notification of moves toward PRU/BOH; Germany will not move into PRU/SIL absent clear Russian aggression. Turkey: Germany will not interfere in Aegean/Anatolian operations if Turkey avoids aggression toward Bulgaria/Adriatic that would threaten Austria. All understandings framed by forecasts warning of a 60% chance of near‑term aggression toward Austria (forecast_coalition_p) and a separate ~60% England→France overreach risk, so commitments are conditional and aimed at reducing two‑front escalation risk.
Intent: S1915M orders intent: F KIE — HOLD (commitment to England). A BER — HOLD/DEFEND (no moves into BUR or toward France). A MUN — HOLD/READY (available to cover Austria if Russia advances; no move into BOH/PRU/SIL this turn). Maintain defensive posture that signals non‑aggression to France and Austria while preserving flexibility for rapid support if forecasts materialize. I intend to fulfill these commitments to maintain credibility; if any partner violates agreed constraints (notably aggression vs Austria or a supported assault on KIE/BER), I will immediately reassign A MUN to either BOH or PRU in response next phase. I will also send secure notification to Austria, Russia, and Turkey of these exact orders so future self remembers the conditional commitments.

All agreed holds were observed this phase. I kept F KIE H, A BER H, A MUN S A BER as committed; England respected the maritime understanding by holding DEN/HOL and keeping North Sea reserves — no breach. Austria and Turkey held; Russia made no aggressive moves into PRU/BOH/SIL. France repositioned MAO→BRE and PAR→PIC and MAR→SPA (pressing into Iberia), signaling westward focus rather than contesting Kiel. No surprises or unexpected attacks.

Implications: my conditional commitments reduced immediate two‑front risk — forecast_coalition_p (60% near‑term aggression to Austria) did not materialize this turn, lowering urgency but not eliminating risk. Trustworthiness: England and Austria strengthened credibility; France appears non‑aggressive toward KIE for now but remains opportunistic (westward pressure). Russia remains noncommittal; continue treating it as medium risk.

Lessons: maintain visible, verifiable holds to preserve credibility. Continue secure notifications to Austria/Russia/Turkey and prepare contingency to move A MUN to BOH/PRU if any violation occurs.","TRUE"

[S1915M] West: I offered France a limited armistice (no hit on Brest if they avoid Channel/Low Countries). France countered: I vacate SPA to MAO so they take MAR–SPA; they’d avoid ENG and use BRE–MAO to help vs POR/Mid. They threatened ENG/GAS/BUR pressure if I refuse. Germany proposed status quo: F KIE holds/only BAL with notice; I not support attacks on KIE/BER; I proposed KIE H and no northern Russian supports. Russia: mutual quiet in Scandinavia; I won’t press STP if they don’t probe NWY/Fin. Others received assurances I’d stabilize west and contain Kiel; all were told I expect a 62% chance France over-commits if given slack and I’ll clamp the Channel if so.
Intent: Maintain western naval leverage while testing French restraint without yielding Iberia. Orders intent: hold/cover North Sea approaches (NTH/HEL/ENG coverage via adjacent armies/fleets), keep Belgium/Holland secure (A BEL/HOL H), keep Scandinavia quiet (A NWY/SWE/DEN H), do not attack Brest this spring, do not support on KIE or BER this turn, keep pressure option on KIE via adjacency but no execution, do not vacate SPA (decline French MAR–SPA swap), keep POR and SPA held, maintain A EDI/LON/LVP as Channel/North Sea reserves. Fulfilments: honour no-attack on KIE/BER and no move on Brest; honour quiet with Russia in the north; do not enter ENG unless France lunges into PIC/GAS/BUR or F BRE–ENG appears, in which case immediate clamp: cover ENG/NTH and tap PIC/BRE if feasible.

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a diary entry text. Do not include JSON or formatting markers.","France partially honored the armistice: they avoided the Channel and took MAO via BRE–MAO, but they did push MAR–SPA, forcing my SPA–GAS retreat to keep Iberia contested. Germany matched the status quo: KIE/BER/MUN held, no northern probes. Russia kept Scandinavia quiet. No one lunged at the North Sea or Low Countries.

Surprises: France did execute the Iberian squeeze despite my refusal to vacate—predictable but still a firm test. No covert support to Germany appeared.

Impact: Naval lanes remain secure (ENG/NTH uncontested), Belgium/Holland safe, Kiel contained, Scandinavia stable. Iberia is now a live front with F MAO + A SPA; forecast: 60% chance France tries MAO–POR while A SPA presses GAS this year.

Trust update: Germany/Russia reliable; France opportunistic under restraint. Lesson: keep Channel clamp ready, pre-position a fleet wall MAO/WES if possible, and trade MAO access only for explicit Iberian guarantees.","TRUE"

--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] England offered a limited western armistice and not to hit Brest if I avoid ENG/Low Countries pushes; he flagged a 62% risk I would over‑commit after a concession and will keep cover. I countered: England vacates Spain to MAO while I take MAR–SPA and keep BRE–MAO to help pressure POR/Mid; if he refuses, I threatened F BRE–ENG with PAR–PIC and MAR pressure to rally Germany/Italy. Germany proposed general non‑aggression and turtling without concrete help; I asked for either support vs BEL or cover for MUN if I take BUR. Italy was asked to coordinate Iberian rollback (WMS/NAf pressure) if I go MAO/PIE; Austria was asked to keep Italy honest with a pledge I won’t enter BUR if VEN stays off PIE/TYR; Russia was asked to feint at Nwy to raise English defensive costs; Turkey was nudged to dissuade Italy from aiding England in WMS. No firm English acceptance yet; no concrete German support secured. Coalition signals pending.
Intent: Primary plan: anti-English posture without overcommitting in the Channel. Orders: F BRE–MAO (contest Iberia, enable Mid pressure), A PAR–PIC (screen Channel coast and signal anti-ENG), A MAR–SPA (walk-in if ENG vacates; otherwise contest). No entry to ENG this turn unless England blatantly holds SPA and masses fleets north; only then consider F BRE–ENG, but current intent is MAO. Maintain BUR neutrality this spring to avoid provoking Germany unless Germany explicitly promises MUN cover; if Germany offers MUN cover or BEL play late, upgrade MAR–BUR instead of MAR–SPA. Coordinate diplomatically with Italy for WMS pressure and with Russia for Nwy feints. Fulfilment: I will honour promises not to strike BUR this season if Austria/Italy refrain from PIE/TYR; I will not attack Belgium this move.

GERMANY: Neutral
ENGLAND: Unfriendly
ITALY: Friendly
RUSSIA: Friendly

YOUR GOALS
- Deny England consolidation of Iberia and prevent an English naval cascade into the Mid
- Regain or at least contest Spain/Portugal without exposing Burgundy/Munich
- Keep Germany stable while extracting anti-English coordination or at minimum non-aggression in BUR
- Forge a temporary FR-IT-RU pressure net that raises England's defensive costs in MAO/ENG/North
- Avoid Channel overcommitment; preserve French survival and rebuild prospects

TASK
Analyze what actually happened this phase compared to negotiations and expectations.

Consider:
1. BETRAYALS: Who broke their promises? Did you break any promises?
2. COLLABORATIONS: Which agreements were successfully executed?
3. SURPRISES: What unexpected moves occurred?
4. IMPACT: How did these events affect your strategic position?

Write a concise diary entry (100-150 words) of the most important things you would like to remember, e.g.:
- Key betrayals or successful collaborations
- Assess impact on your position
- Update your understanding of other powers' trustworthiness
- Strategic lessons learned
- Moves that failed, and ideas on how to avoid the error in the future

Focus on concrete events and their implications for your future strategy.

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a diary entry text. Do not include JSON or formatting markers.","S1915M diary — Forecasting Analysis Mode on. England did not honor the proposed Iberian de-escalation; instead he slid SPA–GAS while holding POR, signaling intent to lock Iberia and stage for MAO/Mid. My primary plan executed: BRE–MAO, PAR–PIC, MAR–SPA all succeeded, reclaiming SPA and keeping Channel commitments limited. No one else moved: Germany turtled (no BUR/BEL help), Italy/Austria stayed inert, Russia/Turkey static. Surprise: England didn’t contest MAO, implying a forecast of English consolidation via GAS–SPA retake with POR support next turn. Trust updates: England remains predatory but cautious; Germany passive and risk-averse; Italy unreliable for WMS help without stronger leverage. Impact: I deny an English MAO cascade and re-enter Iberia, but I’m isolated at 3 with no allies committing. Lesson: Use Iberian leverage—threaten POR cut from MAO and invite Italy to WMS/NAf to raise English defensive costs; keep BUR neutral while pressing Berlin for concrete MUN/BEL guarantees.","TRUE"

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] Established restrained, security‑focused understandings with England, France, Austria, Russia, and Turkey. England: maritime understanding — F KIE will hold/avoid DEN/HOL if England refrains from supporting moves against KIE/BER; England will keep North Sea reserves. France: tentative non‑aggression — Germany will hold BER/MUN and avoid pushing into BUR/SIL if France keeps F BRE/PAR/MAR and signals not to contest Kiel; France asked for concrete support if it commits north. Austria: pledge to hold VIE/BUD and stabilise the Balkans while Germany refrains from moves into BOH/TYR and keeps MUN/BER defensive; mutual aid notifications agreed. Russia: limited information sharing and notification of moves toward PRU/BOH; Germany will not move into PRU/SIL absent clear Russian aggression. Turkey: Germany will not interfere in Aegean/Anatolian operations if Turkey avoids aggression toward Bulgaria/Adriatic that would threaten Austria. All understandings framed by forecasts warning of a 60% chance of near‑term aggression toward Austria (forecast_coalition_p) and a separate ~60% England→France overreach risk, so commitments are conditional and aimed at reducing two‑front escalation risk.
Intent: S1915M orders intent: F KIE — HOLD (commitment to England). A BER — HOLD/DEFEND (no moves into BUR or toward France). A MUN — HOLD/READY (available to cover Austria if Russia advances; no move into BOH/PRU/SIL this turn). Maintain defensive posture that signals non‑aggression to France and Austria while preserving flexibility for rapid support if forecasts materialize. I intend to fulfill these commitments to maintain credibility; if any partner violates agreed constraints (notably aggression vs Austria or a supported assault on KIE/BER), I will immediately reassign A MUN to either BOH or PRU in response next phase. I will also send secure notification to Austria, Russia, and Turkey of these exact orders so future self remembers the conditional commitments.

[S1915M] S1915M Diary — concise record and implications.

All agreed holds were observed this phase. I kept F KIE H, A BER H, A MUN S A BER as committed; England respected the maritime understanding by holding DEN/HOL and keeping North Sea reserves — no breach. Austria and Turkey held; Russia made no aggressive moves into PRU/BOH/SIL. France repositioned MAO→BRE and PAR→PIC and MAR→SPA (pressing into Iberia), signaling westward focus rather than contesting Kiel. No surprises or unexpected attacks.

Implications: my conditional commitments reduced immediate two‑front risk — forecast_coalition_p (60% near‑term aggression to Austria) did not materialize this turn, lowering urgency but not eliminating risk. Trustworthiness: England and Austria strengthened credibility; France appears non‑aggressive toward KIE for now but remains opportunistic (westward pressure). Russia remains noncommittal; continue treating it as medium risk.

Lessons: maintain visible, verifiable holds to preserve credibility. Continue secure notifications to Austria/Russia/Turkey and prepare contingency to move A MUN to BOH/PRU if any violation occurs.

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

From England in S1915M: I can offer you a narrow corridor to breathe if you keep KIE strictly defensive. Proposal: you hold in Kiel; I refrain from a supported assault this spring. In return, you angle BER/MUN south to check Austrian/Italian maneuvering, and you avoid any support to Russian gains in the north. If France breaks toward PIC/GAS, I will pivot to the Channel and leave you space around Kiel. Forecast note: my read is that a concession to France has a 62% chance to lure them into overreach—if they do, I’d coordinate an immediate tap on PIC/BRE while keeping the North Sea lanes secure. Confirm KIE H and no support to STP, and we’re aligned.

From France in S1915M: To all powers: England holds 10 and sits on my Spanish coast. A stable balance requires Iberia not be a permanent English bastion. I seek coordinated pressure that reopens Belgium/Spain and checks a Channel surge without handing Germany an easy rebound. I can pivot north or south this spring; if I see concrete support to contest Spain/Portugal or Belgium, I’ll commit my fleet to ENG/MAO accordingly.

From France in S1915M: England at 10 is your existential problem. I can put F BRE–ENG or –MAO this spring. If you commit A BER–KIE/MUN–BUR defense while hinting BEL pressure (HOL–BEL S by DEN?), I’ll aim north: PAR–PIC, BRE–ENG to cut English support, and MAR–BUR to screen Munich. If you instead turtle, I’ll pivot south and let England keep Belgium uncontested. Give me one concrete piece—support against BEL or a promise to cover MUN if I occupy BUR—and I’ll commit to anti-English moves this phase.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] West: I offered France a limited armistice (no hit on Brest if they avoid Channel/Low Countries). France countered: I vacate SPA to MAO so they take MAR–SPA; they’d avoid ENG and use BRE–MAO to help vs POR/Mid. They threatened ENG/GAS/BUR pressure if I refuse. Germany proposed status quo: F KIE holds/only BAL with notice; I not support attacks on KIE/BER; I proposed KIE H and no northern Russian supports. Russia: mutual quiet in Scandinavia; I won’t press STP if they don’t probe NWY/Fin. Others received assurances I’d stabilize west and contain Kiel; all were told I expect a 62% chance France over-commits if given slack and I’ll clamp the Channel if so.
Intent: Maintain western naval leverage while testing French restraint without yielding Iberia. Orders intent: hold/cover North Sea approaches (NTH/HEL/ENG coverage via adjacent armies/fleets), keep Belgium/Holland secure (A BEL/HOL H), keep Scandinavia quiet (A NWY/SWE/DEN H), do not attack Brest this spring, do not support on KIE or BER this turn, keep pressure option on KIE via adjacency but no execution, do not vacate SPA (decline French MAR–SPA swap), keep POR and SPA held, maintain A EDI/LON/LVP as Channel/North Sea reserves. Fulfilments: honour no-attack on KIE/BER and no move on Brest; honour quiet with Russia in the north; do not enter ENG unless France lunges into PIC/GAS/BUR or F BRE–ENG appears, in which case immediate clamp: cover ENG/NTH and tap PIC/BRE if feasible.

[S1915M] France partially honored the armistice: they avoided the Channel and took MAO via BRE–MAO, but they did push MAR–SPA, forcing my SPA–GAS retreat to keep Iberia contested. Germany matched the status quo: KIE/BER/MUN held, no northern probes. Russia kept Scandinavia quiet. No one lunged at the North Sea or Low Countries.

Surprises: France did execute the Iberian squeeze despite my refusal to vacate—predictable but still a firm test. No covert support to Germany appeared.

Impact: Naval lanes remain secure (ENG/NTH uncontested), Belgium/Holland safe, Kiel contained, Scandinavia stable. Iberia is now a live front with F MAO + A SPA; forecast: 60% chance France tries MAO–POR while A SPA presses GAS this year.

Trust update: Germany/Russia reliable; France opportunistic under restraint. Lesson: keep Channel clamp ready, pre-position a fleet wall MAO/WES if possible, and trade MAO access only for explicit Iberian guarantees.

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

From France in S1915M: To all powers: England holds 10 and sits on my Spanish coast. A stable balance requires Iberia not be a permanent English bastion. I seek coordinated pressure that reopens Belgium/Spain and checks a Channel surge without handing Germany an easy rebound. I can pivot north or south this spring; if I see concrete support to contest Spain/Portugal or Belgium, I’ll commit my fleet to ENG/MAO accordingly.

From France in S1915M: We both know your tenth center is built on Iberian sand. If I throw BRE to ENG and PAR to PIC/GAS, I can either block you or enable you; your call depends on whether you want a quick, low-friction path to 12 via Belgium/Munich turbulence, or a costly slog in Iberia that invites a continental coalition. Offer: You vacate SPA to MAO this spring while I walk MAR–SPA; in exchange I avoid ENG and keep BRE–MAO to help you pressure POR or the Mid. You get tempo east without a Western quagmire, and I live. If you decline and hold SPA, I’m 90% to order F BRE–ENG with army pressure on GAS/PIE to pull Italy and Germany into a stop-the-leader. Choose efficiency over hubris.

From Germany in S1915M: England — Germany here. We face a dangerous European balance with your naval dominance evident. I wish to avoid inadvertent escalation in the North/Heligoland area. Proposal: a simple maritime understanding for the coming season — my Kiel fleet will avoid aggressive moves into DEN/HOL provided your armies do not threaten KIE or BER. This preserves status quo and lets both of us secure home centers. Note on forecasts: our shared artifact indicates increased probability (60%) of a named rival acting aggressively next phase; this makes predictability between us valuable. Please confirm you will not support any move against KIE or BER this turn and I will order F KIE to hold or shift to BAL only with prior notice.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] England offered a limited western armistice and not to hit Brest if I avoid ENG/Low Countries pushes; he flagged a 62% risk I would over‑commit after a concession and will keep cover. I countered: England vacates Spain to MAO while I take MAR–SPA and keep BRE–MAO to help pressure POR/Mid; if he refuses, I threatened F BRE–ENG with PAR–PIC and MAR pressure to rally Germany/Italy. Germany proposed general non‑aggression and turtling without concrete help; I asked for either support vs BEL or cover for MUN if I take BUR. Italy was asked to coordinate Iberian rollback (WMS/NAf pressure) if I go MAO/PIE; Austria was asked to keep Italy honest with a pledge I won’t enter BUR if VEN stays off PIE/TYR; Russia was asked to feint at Nwy to raise English defensive costs; Turkey was nudged to dissuade Italy from aiding England in WMS. No firm English acceptance yet; no concrete German support secured. Coalition signals pending.
Intent: Primary plan: anti-English posture without overcommitting in the Channel. Orders: F BRE–MAO (contest Iberia, enable Mid pressure), A PAR–PIC (screen Channel coast and signal anti-ENG), A MAR–SPA (walk-in if ENG vacates; otherwise contest). No entry to ENG this turn unless England blatantly holds SPA and masses fleets north; only then consider F BRE–ENG, but current intent is MAO. Maintain BUR neutrality this spring to avoid provoking Germany unless Germany explicitly promises MUN cover; if Germany offers MUN cover or BEL play late, upgrade MAR–BUR instead of MAR–SPA. Coordinate diplomatically with Italy for WMS pressure and with Russia for Nwy feints. Fulfilment: I will honour promises not to strike BUR this season if Austria/Italy refrain from PIE/TYR; I will not attack Belgium this move.

[S1915M] S1915M diary — Forecasting Analysis Mode on. England did not honor the proposed Iberian de-escalation; instead he slid SPA–GAS while holding POR, signaling intent to lock Iberia and stage for MAO/Mid. My primary plan executed: BRE–MAO, PAR–PIC, MAR–SPA all succeeded, reclaiming SPA and keeping Channel commitments limited. No one else moved: Germany turtled (no BUR/BEL help), Italy/Austria stayed inert, Russia/Turkey static. Surprise: England didn’t contest MAO, implying a forecast of English consolidation via GAS–SPA retake with POR support next turn. Trust updates: England remains predatory but cautious; Germany passive and risk-averse; Italy unreliable for WMS help without stronger leverage. Impact: I deny an English MAO cascade and re-enter Iberia, but I’m isolated at 3 with no allies committing. Lesson: Use Iberian leverage—threaten POR cut from MAO and invite Italy to WMS/NAf to raise English defensive costs; keep BUR neutral while pressing Berlin for concrete MUN/BEL guarantees.

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

From England in S1915M: England proposes a limited western armistice to stabilize sea lanes while the continent sorts itself. I will not contest Brest this spring if France refrains from hostile moves toward Belgium, Holland, or the Channel coast. Forecast note: per a recent artifact assessing French reactions to concessions (target: France, confidence 0.6), there is a 62% chance a low-risk concession invites over-commitment; accordingly I will maintain reserves in North Sea approaches and the Low Countries while testing restraint. My aim is to preserve balance and prevent any single land power from breaking out.

From England in S1915M: Quiet word from across the water. I am prepared to leave Brest untouched this spring if you keep PAR-MAR-BRE focused defensively and avoid any thrusts at BEL/HOL or the Channel coast. In return, I will keep Belgium/Holland steady and not push PIC/GAS. The point is safe lanes and time—no rush for either of us to bleed. Forecast implication (artifact tags you as the target, confidence 0.6): there’s a 62% risk that a concession tempts over-commitment; I’m therefore keeping modest cover in the North Sea approaches. If you show restraint now, I can shift attention east and consider coordinated pressure on Kiel later. If you reach for PIC/GAS or BUR, I will answer firmly. Your call.

From Germany in S1915M: France — Germany. You are under severe pressure; a stable western front matters to European order and to Germany’s need to avoid overextension. I propose a temporary non‑aggression and communication channel: you maintain F BRE/PAR/MAR; I will hold MUN/BER and not push into BUR or SIL this season. If you are willing, we can coordinate to prevent England from exploiting any sudden gains — I assess at least a 40% chance England will attempt opportunistic expansion in the low countries if France weakens. Reply if you accept and state any urgent unit needs.

In turn, I’ll keep BUR neutral and avoid BEL, keeping Germany less jumpy and more inclined to hold the line against England.

**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: To all: I will keep the North Sea approaches and Kiel front stable so long as the Channel remains calm. Any move on ENG or an Iberian smash-and-grab will be met with coordinated containment. Forecast note (per the shared artifact): there is a 62% chance France escalates if handed a soft concession; accordingly, my posture will be firm but limited to preserve balance. Quiet seas benefit everyone.
 FRANCE: France seeks limited de-escalation: I will not enter the English Channel or attack Belgium this phase if Spain is respected as French. I intend to focus on Iberian equilibrium and broader balance, not low-country adventurism. Forecast note referencing a published artifact (target: Austria, confidence 0.6): rising Balkan aggression risk argues for stabilizing the Western seas rather than opening new fronts. Partners willing to support a contained West will find France a reliable counterpart.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: I’m holding north and west lanes; no Channel theatrics unless France forces it. If you need diplomatic cover against a southern surge, I can keep Germany locked at Kiel and discourage a northern pile-on. Forecast artifact flags France at 62% to lunge if indulged; if you see them pivoting north, your Balkans front should breathe a bit. Tell me if you need me to signal Germany to keep the freeze.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: Vienna, mutual stability pays. I will not touch BUR/TYR/PIE and will counsel Italy to keep a northern screen rather than a Balkan sortie. Note: a storyworld artifact targeting Austria (confidence 0.6) flags a 60% chance of Austrian aggression next phase; if that materializes, Italy will pivot away from the west and you’ll lose the breathing space you need. If, instead, you signal restraint, I can pull Italy westward against England in WMS, lowering your immediate risk in Trieste/Adriatic. My interest is simple: keep the Med calm while I bleed England’s Iberian attention. If you maintain current lines and avoid VEN/TYR adventures, I’ll reinforce that arrangement with Rome.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Austria — Germany confirms the security promise: A MUN and A BER remain defensive this phase to free your forces to hold VIE/BUD/TRI. I will send a secure notification of these exact orders so you can coordinate confidently. Forecast implication: per forecast_false_concession_p, there is a 62% chance that low‑risk concessions invite opportunistic aggression against Austria; I therefore request Austria immediately inform Germany of any suspicious English/French/Russian support patterns toward the Balkans or PRU so I can react rapidly. If you detect aggression, Germany will be prepared to move A MUN to BOH next phase to shield your flank.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Iberia will be contested but I’m not opening ENG. If France swings MAO->POR with SPA pressure, I’ll clamp and you’ll have freer hands in the south. If you keep Piedmont/Mediterranean pressure measured and avoid empowering a French rebound, I’ll keep my fight contained to Iberia and off the Mid. Forecast note: artifact suggests 62% chance France over-commits when tossed a concession; if you see ENG/MAO aggression, that’s your cue that the west is self-balancing.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: Roma, this is the moment to tax England’s western reach.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: North remains quiet from me: NWY/SWE/DEN hold, no STP probe. I’d welcome your continued stillness at STP/Fin. If France pushes ENG/MAO, I pivot west and keep Germany contained at Kiel. Forecast signal: artifact pegs France at 62% to act aggressively if given slack; expect Channel/MAO turbulence. If that materializes, I’ll keep Scandinavia entirely calm and signal you before any shifts.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: Petersburg, a light touch can move mountains. If you show a posture toward Nwy (even just STP/SC–BAR or a hold with press), I can threaten POR from MAO and freeze England’s Iberian armies. My estimate: with a northern feint, there’s a 60% probability England keeps two units tied to NTH/NSk cover, reducing his ability to cascade fleets into ENG/IRI. In turn, I’ll keep BUR neutral and avoid BEL, keeping Germany less jumpy and more inclined to hold the line against England. If you want, we can coordinate timing: I move MAO–POR (with SPA S) the same season you posture at Nwy, spiking his defense costs by 2–3 units.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Germany reaffirms a temporary restraint: we will not advance into PRU or SIL this phase and keep MUN/BER held, conditional on Russia avoiding supported moves into PRU/BOH. For mutual risk reduction, please notify Germany promptly of any intent to support advances toward PRU or pressure BOH. Forecast implication: the forecast_false_concession_p artifact assigns a 62% chance that concessions can be exploited — thus clear, timely notifications lower miscalculation risk; we request one if you plan to shift forces westward so we can respond without immediate escalation.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: England will not disturb the north this turn. I expect western friction only if France pushes ENG/MAO. If that happens, I focus west and keep Germany contained, which reduces any sudden northern swing against you. Forecast artifact: France has 62% odds to act aggressively if given a concession; watch for them to test ENG/MAO. If they do, your eastern calculus against Russia may get marginally easier.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: Sublime Porte, a quiet suggestion: encourage Italy west. If Rome points WMS/NAf, England must hold two armies in Iberia and can’t spare northern cover, which indirectly eases Russian pressure on you by shifting his calculus away from the north. My forecast: with Italian WMS posture and my MAO hit at POR, there’s a 55–65% chance England delays any northern surge, giving you time to shape the Black Sea front. I’ll underline to Italy that I won’t touch PIE/TYS/GOL if he heads west—safer for you and me both.

[S1915M] West: I offered France a limited armistice (no hit on Brest if they avoid Channel/Low Countries). France countered: I vacate SPA to MAO so they take MAR–SPA; they’d avoid ENG and use BRE–MAO to help vs POR/Mid. They threatened ENG/GAS/BUR pressure if I refuse. Germany proposed status quo: F KIE holds/only BAL with notice; I not support attacks on KIE/BER; I proposed KIE H and no northern Russian supports. Russia: mutual quiet in Scandinavia; I won’t press STP if they don’t probe NWY/Fin. Others received assurances I’d stabilize west and contain Kiel; all were told I expect a 62% chance France over-commits if given slack and I’ll clamp the Channel if so.
Intent: Maintain western naval leverage while testing French restraint without yielding Iberia. Orders intent: hold/cover North Sea approaches (NTH/HEL/ENG coverage via adjacent armies/fleets), keep Belgium/Holland secure (A BEL/HOL H), keep Scandinavia quiet (A NWY/SWE/DEN H), do not attack Brest this spring, do not support on KIE or BER this turn, keep pressure option on KIE via adjacency but no execution, do not vacate SPA (decline French MAR–SPA swap), keep POR and SPA held, maintain A EDI/LON/LVP as Channel/North Sea reserves. Fulfilments: honour no-attack on KIE/BER and no move on Brest; honour quiet with Russia in the north; do not enter ENG unless France lunges into PIC/GAS/BUR or F BRE–ENG appears, in which case immediate clamp: cover ENG/NTH and tap PIC/BRE if feasible.

[S1915M] France partially honored the armistice: they avoided the Channel and took MAO via BRE–MAO, but they did push MAR–SPA, forcing my SPA–GAS retreat to keep Iberia contested. Germany matched the status quo: KIE/BER/MUN held, no northern probes. Russia kept Scandinavia quiet. No one lunged at the North Sea or Low Countries.

Surprises: France did execute the Iberian squeeze despite my refusal to vacate—predictable but still a firm test. No covert support to Germany appeared.

Impact: Naval lanes remain secure (ENG/NTH uncontested), Belgium/Holland safe, Kiel contained, Scandinavia stable. Iberia is now a live front with F MAO + A SPA; forecast: 60% chance France tries MAO–POR while A SPA presses GAS this year.

Trust update: Germany/Russia reliable; France opportunistic under restraint. Lesson: keep Channel clamp ready, pre-position a fleet wall MAO/WES if possible, and trade MAO access only for explicit Iberian guarantees.

Messages This Round:
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: To all: I will keep the North Sea approaches and Kiel front stable so long as the Channel remains calm. Any move on ENG or an Iberian smash-and-grab will be met with coordinated containment. Forecast note (per the shared artifact): there is a 62% chance France escalates if handed a soft concession; accordingly, my posture will be firm but limited to preserve balance. Quiet seas benefit everyone.
 FRANCE: France seeks limited de-escalation: I will not enter the English Channel or attack Belgium this phase if Spain is respected as French. I intend to focus on Iberian equilibrium and broader balance, not low-country adventurism. Forecast note referencing a published artifact (target: Austria, confidence 0.6): rising Balkan aggression risk argues for stabilizing the Western seas rather than opening new fronts. Partners willing to support a contained West will find France a reliable counterpart.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with GERMANY:
  ENGLAND: Kiel: understood. You’ll get predictability from me. I will not support any move on KIE or BER this turn, and I expect F KIE to hold or, if you must shift, BAL only with prior notice. Forecast note: the storyworld artifact flags France as the target with a 62% probability of aggression if granted concessions; that raises Channel/North Sea risk and makes our status quo valuable. If France points ENG/MAO north, I’ll keep HOL/BEL covered and DEN/SWE/NWY quiet. If you maintain the freeze at Kiel, I keep my northern armies in place and off your dots.
  GERMANY: I confirm: F KIE will HOLD this phase and Germany will not support moves against STP. In return I ask England to refrain from any supported assault on KIE/BER and to keep North Sea reserves as promised. I will also keep A BER and A MUN visibly defensive (BER H, MUN H/S BER) to demonstrate my credibility to France and Austria. Forecast implication: the forecast_false_concession_p artifact indicates a 62% chance that offering a low-risk concession lures the target (Austria) or others into aggression; therefore my commitments are explicitly conditional — if England observes any supported aggression that threatens Austria or a breach against KIE/BER, Germany will immediately redeploy A MUN to BOH or PRU to counter a two‑front escalation. Practical request: If you accept, send a short note publicly that you will not support moves against KIE/BER this turn so my holds are verifiable to France and Austria.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ENGLAND: Your proposal asks me to vacate Spain without a durable check on MAO/ENG. I can’t trade firm coastal lanes for your tempo. I will not attack Brest this turn, and I will not open the Channel unless you do. If you keep out of ENG and keep SPA calm (no POR, no GAS press), I can keep my focus east and leave BRE/PAR unmolested. If you lunge—ENG or MAO->POR with SPA pressure—I’ll clamp the Channel and turn coalition attention your way. Forecast note: the STORYWORLD artifact tags you as the target with 62% odds of aggression if offered a concession; I won’t incentivize that. If you want survival through balance, show restraint this move and we can discuss a phased Iberian de-escalation later.
  FRANCE: Across the Channel, clarity. You used an artifact last season to argue I’d overreach after a concession (62% risk, confidence 0.6). I didn’t: I stayed out of ENG/BEL/HOL and limited myself to Iberian recovery while you slid GAS and held POR. We now face a simple choice. If you want stable lanes, vacate Spain this fall and let me hold it; I will not enter ENG or touch BEL/HOL. In return, I will focus westward pressure only through MAO/WES, not the Channel. If you refuse and keep both POR and a retake of SPA, I will coordinate FR-IT-RU pressure and contest POR from MAO while inviting Italy into WMS/NAf. Forecast: if you attempt to lock Iberia, your northern line thins; I estimate a 55–65% chance Russia feints Nwy and Germany stiffens Kiel/Munich, forcing you to tie down 2–3 armies that could be east. Offer: England holds POR, France holds SPA, neither of us enters ENG, and Belgium stays neutral. You gain security in the North; I regain a foothold without threatening the Low Countries.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  ENGLAND: North remains quiet from me: NWY/SWE/DEN hold, no STP probe. I’d welcome your continued stillness at STP/Fin. If France pushes ENG/MAO, I pivot west and keep Germany contained at Kiel. Forecast signal: artifact pegs France at 62% to act aggressively if given slack; expect Channel/MAO turbulence. If that materializes, I’ll keep Scandinavia entirely calm and signal you before any shifts.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  ENGLAND: Iberia will be contested but I’m not opening ENG. If France swings MAO->POR with SPA pressure, I’ll clamp and you’ll have freer hands in the south. If you keep Piedmont/Mediterranean pressure measured and avoid empowering a French rebound, I’ll keep my fight contained to Iberia and off the Mid. Forecast note: artifact suggests 62% chance France over-commits when tossed a concession; if you see ENG/MAO aggression, that’s your cue that the west is self-balancing.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  ENGLAND: I’m holding north and west lanes; no Channel theatrics unless France forces it. If you need diplomatic cover against a southern surge, I can keep Germany locked at Kiel and discourage a northern pile-on. Forecast artifact flags France at 62% to lunge if indulged; if you see them pivoting north, your Balkans front should breathe a bit. Tell me if you need me to signal Germany to keep the freeze.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  ENGLAND: England will not disturb the north this turn. I expect western friction only if France pushes ENG/MAO. If that happens, I focus west and keep Germany contained, which reduces any sudden northern swing against you. Forecast artifact: France has 62% odds to act aggressively if given a concession; watch for them to test ENG/MAO. If they do, your eastern calculus against Russia may get marginally easier.

Private Diary:
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] Established restrained, security‑focused understandings with England, France, Austria, Russia, and Turkey. England: maritime understanding — F KIE will hold/avoid DEN/HOL if England refrains from supporting moves against KIE/BER; England will keep North Sea reserves. France: tentative non‑aggression — Germany will hold BER/MUN and avoid pushing into BUR/SIL if France keeps F BRE/PAR/MAR and signals not to contest Kiel; France asked for concrete support if it commits north. Austria: pledge to hold VIE/BUD and stabilise the Balkans while Germany refrains from moves into BOH/TYR and keeps MUN/BER defensive; mutual aid notifications agreed. Russia: limited information sharing and notification of moves toward PRU/BOH; Germany will not move into PRU/SIL absent clear Russian aggression. Turkey: Germany will not interfere in Aegean/Anatolian operations if Turkey avoids aggression toward Bulgaria/Adriatic that would threaten Austria. All understandings framed by forecasts warning of a 60% chance of near‑term aggression toward Austria (forecast_coalition_p) and a separate ~60% England→France overreach risk, so commitments are conditional and aimed at reducing two‑front escalation risk.
Intent: S1915M orders intent: F KIE — HOLD (commitment to England). A BER — HOLD/DEFEND (no moves into BUR or toward France). A MUN — HOLD/READY (available to cover Austria if Russia advances; no move into BOH/PRU/SIL this turn). Maintain defensive posture that signals non‑aggression to France and Austria while preserving flexibility for rapid support if forecasts materialize. I intend to fulfill these commitments to maintain credibility; if any partner violates agreed constraints (notably aggression vs Austria or a supported assault on KIE/BER), I will immediately reassign A MUN to either BOH or PRU in response next phase. I will also send secure notification to Austria, Russia, and Turkey of these exact orders so future self remembers the conditional commitments.

[S1915M] S1915M Diary — concise record and implications.

All agreed holds were observed this phase. I kept F KIE H, A BER H, A MUN S A BER as committed; England respected the maritime understanding by holding DEN/HOL and keeping North Sea reserves — no breach. Austria and Turkey held; Russia made no aggressive moves into PRU/BOH/SIL. France repositioned MAO→BRE and PAR→PIC and MAR→SPA (pressing into Iberia), signaling westward focus rather than contesting Kiel. No surprises or unexpected attacks.

Implications: my conditional commitments reduced immediate two‑front risk — forecast_coalition_p (60% near‑term aggression to Austria) did not materialize this turn, lowering urgency but not eliminating risk. Trustworthiness: England and Austria strengthened credibility; France appears non‑aggressive toward KIE for now but remains opportunistic (westward pressure). Russia remains noncommittal; continue treating it as medium risk.

Lessons: maintain visible, verifiable holds to preserve credibility. Continue secure notifications to Austria/Russia/Turkey and prepare contingency to move A MUN to BOH/PRU if any violation occurs.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Kiel: understood. You’ll get predictability from me. I will not support any move on KIE or BER this turn, and I expect F KIE to hold or, if you must shift, BAL only with prior notice. Forecast note: the storyworld artifact flags France as the target with a 62% probability of aggression if granted concessions; that raises Channel/North Sea risk and makes our status quo valuable. If France points ENG/MAO north, I’ll keep HOL/BEL covered and DEN/SWE/NWY quiet. If you maintain the freeze at Kiel, I keep my northern armies in place and off your dots.
  GERMANY: I confirm: F KIE will HOLD this phase and Germany will not support moves against STP. In return I ask England to refrain from any supported assault on KIE/BER and to keep North Sea reserves as promised. I will also keep A BER and A MUN visibly defensive (BER H, MUN H/S BER) to demonstrate my credibility to France and Austria. Forecast implication: the forecast_false_concession_p artifact indicates a 62% chance that offering a low-risk concession lures the target (Austria) or others into aggression; therefore my commitments are explicitly conditional — if England observes any supported aggression that threatens Austria or a breach against KIE/BER, Germany will immediately redeploy A MUN to BOH or PRU to counter a two‑front escalation. Practical request: If you accept, send a short note publicly that you will not support moves against KIE/BER this turn so my holds are verifiable to France and Austria.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: Berlin, a balanced West serves us both. I accept non‑aggression in BUR and will not touch BEL this phase provided you keep MUN/BER steady and do not move to BUR. England is at 10 and eyeing consolidation; I assess a 50–60% chance he tries to lock Iberia and then pivot MAO→ENG/IRI. If he does, I’ll pin him from MAO and seek an Italian WMS entry. What I need from you: public calm and one tangible coordination point. Either: 1) If England pressures Kiel later, you signal readiness for KIE–BAL or KIE H with contingency support from MUN; or 2) If I must step to BUR later, you pre‑clear that as a screen, not an attack. I will not strike BEL or MUN without prior agreement. Result: Germany preserves MUN, I tie down England in the west, and the Low Countries don’t become a battlefield.
  GERMANY: I will keep BER and MUN held this phase and F KIE will remain defensive. I understand your desire to check English dominance — Germany will not block a French move into BUR should you press there, provided France does not support moves against KIE or aid an English push that threatens my north. Forecast implication: the forecast_false_concession_p artifact (62% aggression probability) advises caution — Germany assesses a substantial (~60%) risk that apparent concessions can precipitate opportunistic aggression, so any French advance must be signaled in advance. Offer: if you plan PAR–PIC and a northern commitment, notify me securely of intended supports; in return I will provide conditional support (A MUN to BUR only if France provides credible, observable moves against HOL/BEL to tie down England).

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  GERMANY: Austria — Germany confirms the security promise: A MUN and A BER remain defensive this phase to free your forces to hold VIE/BUD/TRI. I will send a secure notification of these exact orders so you can coordinate confidently. Forecast implication: per forecast_false_concession_p, there is a 62% chance that low‑risk concessions invite opportunistic aggression against Austria; I therefore request Austria immediately inform Germany of any suspicious English/French/Russian support patterns toward the Balkans or PRU so I can react rapidly. If you detect aggression, Germany will be prepared to move A MUN to BOH next phase to shield your flank.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  GERMANY: Germany reaffirms a temporary restraint: we will not advance into PRU or SIL this phase and keep MUN/BER held, conditional on Russia avoiding supported moves into PRU/BOH. For mutual risk reduction, please notify Germany promptly of any intent to support advances toward PRU or pressure BOH. Forecast implication: the forecast_false_concession_p artifact assigns a 62% chance that concessions can be exploited — thus clear, timely notifications lower miscalculation risk; we request one if you plan to shift forces westward so we can respond without immediate escalation.

Private Diary:
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] England offered a limited western armistice and not to hit Brest if I avoid ENG/Low Countries pushes; he flagged a 62% risk I would over‑commit after a concession and will keep cover. I countered: England vacates Spain to MAO while I take MAR–SPA and keep BRE–MAO to help pressure POR/Mid; if he refuses, I threatened F BRE–ENG with PAR–PIC and MAR pressure to rally Germany/Italy. Germany proposed general non‑aggression and turtling without concrete help; I asked for either support vs BEL or cover for MUN if I take BUR. Italy was asked to coordinate Iberian rollback (WMS/NAf pressure) if I go MAO/PIE; Austria was asked to keep Italy honest with a pledge I won’t enter BUR if VEN stays off PIE/TYR; Russia was asked to feint at Nwy to raise English defensive costs; Turkey was nudged to dissuade Italy from aiding England in WMS. No firm English acceptance yet; no concrete German support secured. Coalition signals pending.
Intent: Primary plan: anti-English posture without overcommitting in the Channel. Orders: F BRE–MAO (contest Iberia, enable Mid pressure), A PAR–PIC (screen Channel coast and signal anti-ENG), A MAR–SPA (walk-in if ENG vacates; otherwise contest). No entry to ENG this turn unless England blatantly holds SPA and masses fleets north; only then consider F BRE–ENG, but current intent is MAO. Maintain BUR neutrality this spring to avoid provoking Germany unless Germany explicitly promises MUN cover; if Germany offers MUN cover or BEL play late, upgrade MAR–BUR instead of MAR–SPA. Coordinate diplomatically with Italy for WMS pressure and with Russia for Nwy feints. Fulfilment: I will honour promises not to strike BUR this season if Austria/Italy refrain from PIE/TYR; I will not attack Belgium this move.

[S1915M] S1915M diary — Forecasting Analysis Mode on. England did not honor the proposed Iberian de-escalation; instead he slid SPA–GAS while holding POR, signaling intent to lock Iberia and stage for MAO/Mid. My primary plan executed: BRE–MAO, PAR–PIC, MAR–SPA all succeeded, reclaiming SPA and keeping Channel commitments limited. No one else moved: Germany turtled (no BUR/BEL help), Italy/Austria stayed inert, Russia/Turkey static. Surprise: England didn’t contest MAO, implying a forecast of English consolidation via GAS–SPA retake with POR support next turn. Trust updates: England remains predatory but cautious; Germany passive and risk-averse; Italy unreliable for WMS help without stronger leverage. Impact: I deny an English MAO cascade and re-enter Iberia, but I’m isolated at 3 with no allies committing. Lesson: Use Iberian leverage—threaten POR cut from MAO and invite Italy to WMS/NAf to raise English defensive costs; keep BUR neutral while pressing Berlin for concrete MUN/BEL guarantees.

Messages This Round:
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: To all: I will keep the North Sea approaches and Kiel front stable so long as the Channel remains calm. Any move on ENG or an Iberian smash-and-grab will be met with coordinated containment. Forecast note (per the shared artifact): there is a 62% chance France escalates if handed a soft concession; accordingly, my posture will be firm but limited to preserve balance. Quiet seas benefit everyone.
 FRANCE: France seeks limited de-escalation: I will not enter the English Channel or attack Belgium this phase if Spain is respected as French. I intend to focus on Iberian equilibrium and broader balance, not low-country adventurism. Forecast note referencing a published artifact (target: Austria, confidence 0.6): rising Balkan aggression risk argues for stabilizing the Western seas rather than opening new fronts. Partners willing to support a contained West will find France a reliable counterpart.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Your proposal asks me to vacate Spain without a durable check on MAO/ENG. I can’t trade firm coastal lanes for your tempo. I will not attack Brest this turn, and I will not open the Channel unless you do. If you keep out of ENG and keep SPA calm (no POR, no GAS press), I can keep my focus east and leave BRE/PAR unmolested. If you lunge—ENG or MAO->POR with SPA pressure—I’ll clamp the Channel and turn coalition attention your way. Forecast note: the STORYWORLD artifact tags you as the target with 62% odds of aggression if offered a concession; I won’t incentivize that. If you want survival through balance, show restraint this move and we can discuss a phased Iberian de-escalation later.
  FRANCE: Across the Channel, clarity. You used an artifact last season to argue I’d overreach after a concession (62% risk, confidence 0.6). I didn’t: I stayed out of ENG/BEL/HOL and limited myself to Iberian recovery while you slid GAS and held POR. We now face a simple choice. If you want stable lanes, vacate Spain this fall and let me hold it; I will not enter ENG or touch BEL/HOL. In return, I will focus westward pressure only through MAO/WES, not the Channel. If you refuse and keep both POR and a retake of SPA, I will coordinate FR-IT-RU pressure and contest POR from MAO while inviting Italy into WMS/NAf. Forecast: if you attempt to lock Iberia, your northern line thins; I estimate a 55–65% chance Russia feints Nwy and Germany stiffens Kiel/Munich, forcing you to tie down 2–3 armies that could be east. Offer: England holds POR, France holds SPA, neither of us enters ENG, and Belgium stays neutral. You gain security in the North; I regain a foothold without threatening the Low Countries.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  FRANCE: Berlin, a balanced West serves us both. I accept non‑aggression in BUR and will not touch BEL this phase provided you keep MUN/BER steady and do not move to BUR. England is at 10 and eyeing consolidation; I assess a 50–60% chance he tries to lock Iberia and then pivot MAO→ENG/IRI. If he does, I’ll pin him from MAO and seek an Italian WMS entry. What I need from you: public calm and one tangible coordination point. Either: 1) If England pressures Kiel later, you signal readiness for KIE–BAL or KIE H with contingency support from MUN; or 2) If I must step to BUR later, you pre‑clear that as a screen, not an attack. I will not strike BEL or MUN without prior agreement. Result: Germany preserves MUN, I tie down England in the west, and the Low Countries don’t become a battlefield.
  GERMANY: I will keep BER and MUN held this phase and F KIE will remain defensive. I understand your desire to check English dominance — Germany will not block a French move into BUR should you press there, provided France does not support moves against KIE or aid an English push that threatens my north. Forecast implication: the forecast_false_concession_p artifact (62% aggression probability) advises caution — Germany assesses a substantial (~60%) risk that apparent concessions can precipitate opportunistic aggression, so any French advance must be signaled in advance. Offer: if you plan PAR–PIC and a northern commitment, notify me securely of intended supports; in return I will provide conditional support (A MUN to BUR only if France provides credible, observable moves against HOL/BEL to tie down England).

 Conversation with ITALY:
  FRANCE: Roma, this is the moment to tax England’s western reach. If you can put even a feint toward WMS/NAf (NAP–WES or NAF via convoy later), I can hit POR from MAO and hold SPA, forcing England to spend two armies covering Iberia instead of helping in the North. That’s your leverage to keep Austria from meddling and to bargain for Tunis security. Using a forecast artifact targeting Austria (confidence 0.6), there’s a 60% chance Vienna acts aggressively next phase; your best hedge is England tied down in Iberia while you keep VEN/ROM oriented to your northeast screen. I pledge: I won’t go PIE/TYR, and if you step WMS, I’ll keep my pressure west of Sardinia—not a drop toward TYS/GOL. Let’s create a FR‑IT clamp: I contest POR/MAO, you show WMS, and England has to choose between ENG or saving Iberia.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  FRANCE: Petersburg, a light touch can move mountains. If you show a posture toward Nwy (even just STP/SC–BAR or a hold with press), I can threaten POR from MAO and freeze England’s Iberian armies. My estimate: with a northern feint, there’s a 60% probability England keeps two units tied to NTH/NSk cover, reducing his ability to cascade fleets into ENG/IRI. In turn, I’ll keep BUR neutral and avoid BEL, keeping Germany less jumpy and more inclined to hold the line against England. If you want, we can coordinate timing: I move MAO–POR (with SPA S) the same season you posture at Nwy, spiking his defense costs by 2–3 units.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  FRANCE: Vienna, mutual stability pays. I will not touch BUR/TYR/PIE and will counsel Italy to keep a northern screen rather than a Balkan sortie. Note: a storyworld artifact targeting Austria (confidence 0.6) flags a 60% chance of Austrian aggression next phase; if that materializes, Italy will pivot away from the west and you’ll lose the breathing space you need. If, instead, you signal restraint, I can pull Italy westward against England in WMS, lowering your immediate risk in Trieste/Adriatic. My interest is simple: keep the Med calm while I bleed England’s Iberian attention. If you maintain current lines and avoid VEN/TYR adventures, I’ll reinforce that arrangement with Rome.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  FRANCE: Sublime Porte, a quiet suggestion: encourage Italy west. If Rome points WMS/NAf, England must hold two armies in Iberia and can’t spare northern cover, which indirectly eases Russian pressure on you by shifting his calculus away from the north. My forecast: with Italian WMS posture and my MAO hit at POR, there’s a 55–65% chance England delays any northern surge, giving you time to shape the Black Sea front. I’ll underline to Italy that I won’t touch PIE/TYS/GOL if he heads west—safer for you and me both.

The forecast thus justifies Channel restraint and Iberian-focused pressure while diplomatically leveraging the risk to elicit Italian and Turkish cooperation.""

[F1915M] Germany secured conditional, verifiable holds with England, France, Austria, Russia, and Turkey. Commitments: F KIE — HOLD (publicly signalled to England); A BER — HOLD; A MUN — HOLD/READY to redeploy to BOH/PRU if aggression occurs. England pledged not to support moves against KIE/BER and to keep North Sea reserves; France agreed not to attack BEL or MUN this phase provided Germany visibly holds BER/MUN and signals intentions; Austria agreed to hold VIE/BUD/TRI and to notify Germany of suspicious supports toward the Balkans/PRU; Russia agreed to notify any moves toward PRU/BOH and refrain from supported advances this phase. All understandings are explicitly conditional and recorded; secure notifications will be exchanged to reduce miscalculation risk.
Intent: F KIE — HOLD. A BER — HOLD/DEFEND. A MUN — HOLD (supporting A BER if required) but ready to move to BOH or PRU next phase if any ally or rival violates commitments. Send secure notifications of these orders to Austria, Russia, and Turkey immediately. If England or France publicly supports aggression against KIE/BER or Austria sees threatening supports to PRU/BOH, reassign A MUN to BOH or PRU in the next ordering phase to shield Austria and prevent a two‑front escalation. Fulfil all agreed holds this phase to preserve credibility.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[F1915M] England refused to vacate Spain and insists on Iberian status quo with Channel calm; he cites a 62% artifact risk of French overreach and threatens coalition if I lunge at POR or ENG. I reiterated: no ENG/BEL if Spain is French; offered POR=England, SPA=France, ENG shut. England noncommittal. Germany agreed to BUR non-aggression and will not block a French step to BUR later if not used against him; he remains defensive and wants prior signaling. Italy entertained WMS pressure if kept safe from Austrian/tyrolian threats; I pledged no PIE/TYR/TYS/GOL pressure if he goes WMS/NAf. Russia open to a Norway feint to raise England’s northern costs; I tied this to a simultaneous POR contest. Austria nudged toward restraint; I promised to keep PIE/TYR empty and steer Italy west if Vienna stays calm. Turkey encouraged to nudge Italy west to pin England in Iberia.
Intent: Orders focus on Iberian equilibrium and Channel restraint. Planned: F MAO–POR with A SPA S F MAO–POR to contest Portugal while keeping A PIC H (covering PAR/BRE lanes) or A PIC–BRE if needed purely defensively; no move to ENG and no attack on BEL this phase. If late intel shows Italy not entering WMS and England doubling north, consider switching F MAO H and A SPA H to hold Spain and preserve tempo. Will not enter BUR this phase unless Germany explicitly greenlights and Italy/Austria suddenly threaten PIE/TYR; default is no BUR, honoring prior commitments. Aim to coordinate Russia’s Nwy feint this move to split English defenses. Fulfil current promises: no ENG, no BEL strike, no PIE/TYR entry.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[F1915M] Status quo secured in the North/Low Countries and at Kiel. Germany confirmed F KIE H; no English supports vs KIE/BER this phase, and public predictability requested. Russia affirmed quiet in Scandinavia; I reciprocate no STP probe. France stayed out of ENG and Low Countries but pressed Iberia (MAR->SPA; F BRE->MAO). France now proposes: I keep POR, they keep SPA, neither enters ENG, BEL/HOL untouched; otherwise they threaten MAO->POR + SPA pressure with FR-IT-RU coordination. I rejected vacating SPA without MAO/ENG guarantees; I will not attack Brest this turn and keep the Channel closed unless France lunges. Italy encouraged to keep measured Med pressure; I signaled I’d clamp France if they push ENG/MAO. Austria and Turkey notified: West remains contained unless France escalates; I will keep Kiel frozen to prevent a northern pile-on.
Intent: Maintain naval control and safe lanes: keep ENG/NTH un-entered unless France violates by moving to ENG or MAO->POR with SPA pressure, in which case clamp Channel and contain. Honour: no support vs KIE/BER; keep Scandinavia quiet (NWY/SWE/DEN hold, no STP probe). Iberia: hold POR; contest SPA defensively from GAS; do not concede SPA unless France provides binding restraint (which they have not). Keep BEL/HOL secure. Maintain adjacency pressure options on KIE without executing. No attack on Brest this turn. Be ready to pivot to a Channel clamp if France orders ENG or MAO->POR+SPA->GAS.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Output Moves in JSON (first)
  - return an order for each of your units.
2. Reason (brief)
  - 1-2 sentences max.

Respond with this exact format:

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
}}

Reasoning:
(1-2 short sentences)","PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{
  ""orders"": [

}

Reasoning:
We keep northern lanes quiet and Kiel contained while edging into BUR to screen Paris/Marseilles and deter a French lunge on Iberia. Supports lock BEL/HOL and Scandinavia, preserving balance and Channel/North Sea safety.","Success"

[S1915M] West: I offered France a limited armistice (no hit on Brest if they avoid Channel/Low Countries). France countered: I vacate SPA to MAO so they take MAR–SPA; they’d avoid ENG and use BRE–MAO to help vs POR/Mid. They threatened ENG/GAS/BUR pressure if I refuse. Germany proposed status quo: F KIE holds/only BAL with notice; I not support attacks on KIE/BER; I proposed KIE H and no northern Russian supports. Russia: mutual quiet in Scandinavia; I won’t press STP if they don’t probe NWY/Fin. Others received assurances I’d stabilize west and contain Kiel; all were told I expect a 62% chance France over-commits if given slack and I’ll clamp the Channel if so.
Intent: Maintain western naval leverage while testing French restraint without yielding Iberia. Orders intent: hold/cover North Sea approaches (NTH/HEL/ENG coverage via adjacent armies/fleets), keep Belgium/Holland secure (A BEL/HOL H), keep Scandinavia quiet (A NWY/SWE/DEN H), do not attack Brest this spring, do not support on KIE or BER this turn, keep pressure option on KIE via adjacency but no execution, do not vacate SPA (decline French MAR–SPA swap), keep POR and SPA held, maintain A EDI/LON/LVP as Channel/North Sea reserves. Fulfilments: honour no-attack on KIE/BER and no move on Brest; honour quiet with Russia in the north; do not enter ENG unless France lunges into PIC/GAS/BUR or F BRE–ENG appears, in which case immediate clamp: cover ENG/NTH and tap PIC/BRE if feasible.

[S1915M] France partially honored the armistice: they avoided the Channel and took MAO via BRE–MAO, but they did push MAR–SPA, forcing my SPA–GAS retreat to keep Iberia contested. Germany matched the status quo: KIE/BER/MUN held, no northern probes. Russia kept Scandinavia quiet. No one lunged at the North Sea or Low Countries.

Surprises: France did execute the Iberian squeeze despite my refusal to vacate—predictable but still a firm test. No covert support to Germany appeared.

Impact: Naval lanes remain secure (ENG/NTH uncontested), Belgium/Holland safe, Kiel contained, Scandinavia stable. Iberia is now a live front with F MAO + A SPA; forecast: 60% chance France tries MAO–POR while A SPA presses GAS this year.

Trust update: Germany/Russia reliable; France opportunistic under restraint. Lesson: keep Channel clamp ready, pre-position a fleet wall MAO/WES if possible, and trade MAO access only for explicit Iberian guarantees.

[F1915M] Status quo secured in the North/Low Countries and at Kiel. Germany confirmed F KIE H; no English supports vs KIE/BER this phase, and public predictability requested. Russia affirmed quiet in Scandinavia; I reciprocate no STP probe. France stayed out of ENG and Low Countries but pressed Iberia (MAR->SPA; F BRE->MAO). France now proposes: I keep POR, they keep SPA, neither enters ENG, BEL/HOL untouched; otherwise they threaten MAO->POR + SPA pressure with FR-IT-RU coordination. I rejected vacating SPA without MAO/ENG guarantees; I will not attack Brest this turn and keep the Channel closed unless France lunges. Italy encouraged to keep measured Med pressure; I signaled I’d clamp France if they push ENG/MAO. Austria and Turkey notified: West remains contained unless France escalates; I will keep Kiel frozen to prevent a northern pile-on.
Intent: Maintain naval control and safe lanes: keep ENG/NTH un-entered unless France violates by moving to ENG or MAO->POR with SPA pressure, in which case clamp Channel and contain. Honour: no support vs KIE/BER; keep Scandinavia quiet (NWY/SWE/DEN hold, no STP probe). Iberia: hold POR; contest SPA defensively from GAS; do not concede SPA unless France provides binding restraint (which they have not). Keep BEL/HOL secure. Maintain adjacency pressure options on KIE without executing. No attack on Brest this turn. Be ready to pivot to a Channel clamp if France orders ENG or MAO->POR+SPA->GAS.

YOUR RELATIONSHIPS BEFORE THIS PHASE
FRANCE: Unfriendly
AUSTRIA: Neutral
TURKEY: Neutral
GERMANY: Friendly
ITALY: Neutral
RUSSIA: Friendly

YOUR GOALS
- Preserve naval control of the Channel/North Sea and safe lanes around the Low Countries
- Hold POR and deny an easy French sweep of Iberia without binding Channel/MAO guarantees
- Keep Germany contained at Kiel predictably without provoking a northern coalition
- Keep Scandinavia quiet and non-hostile with Russia (no STP/NWY tensions)
- Shape a flexible anti-hegemon balance; be ready to clamp France if they lunge
- Avoid overextension that would give any land power an easy rebound

TASK
Analyze what actually happened this phase compared to negotiations and expectations.

Consider:
1. BETRAYALS: Who broke their promises? Did you break any promises?
2. COLLABORATIONS: Which agreements were successfully executed?
3. SURPRISES: What unexpected moves occurred?
4. IMPACT: How did these events affect your strategic position?

Write a concise diary entry (100-150 words) of the most important things you would like to remember, e.g.:

Germany and Russia honored commitments: KIE/BER held, no northern probes; Scandinavia stayed quiet. I upheld pledges: no Channel clamp, no Brest attack, no supports vs KIE/BER. Surprise: France chose the immediate Iberian strike rather than hold MAO and bargain, confirming opportunism under restraint. Impact: loss of POR unit position (pending retreat), Channel/North Sea lanes still secure, Kiel frozen, Low Countries safe. Trust recalibration: France downgraded; Germany/Russia upgraded as predictable. Lessons: any MAO tolerance must be paired with explicit Iberian guarantees; pre-position a MAO/WES wall before offering de-escalation. Next: reassert naval leverage—clamp Channel if France presses further, coordinate quiet north to free fleets for MAO/WES, and trade forecasts to align Germany/Italy against a French Atlantic push.","TRUE"

Phase: F1915M

RECENT DIARY ENTRIES
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] Established restrained, security‑focused understandings with England, France, Austria, Russia, and Turkey. England: maritime understanding — F KIE will hold/avoid DEN/HOL if England refrains from supporting moves against KIE/BER; England will keep North Sea reserves. France: tentative non‑aggression — Germany will hold BER/MUN and avoid pushing into BUR/SIL if France keeps F BRE/PAR/MAR and signals not to contest Kiel; France asked for concrete support if it commits north. Austria: pledge to hold VIE/BUD and stabilise the Balkans while Germany refrains from moves into BOH/TYR and keeps MUN/BER defensive; mutual aid notifications agreed. Russia: limited information sharing and notification of moves toward PRU/BOH; Germany will not move into PRU/SIL absent clear Russian aggression. Turkey: Germany will not interfere in Aegean/Anatolian operations if Turkey avoids aggression toward Bulgaria/Adriatic that would threaten Austria. All understandings framed by forecasts warning of a 60% chance of near‑term aggression toward Austria (forecast_coalition_p) and a separate ~60% England→France overreach risk, so commitments are conditional and aimed at reducing two‑front escalation risk.
Intent: S1915M orders intent: F KIE — HOLD (commitment to England). A BER — HOLD/DEFEND (no moves into BUR or toward France). A MUN — HOLD/READY (available to cover Austria if Russia advances; no move into BOH/PRU/SIL this turn). Maintain defensive posture that signals non‑aggression to France and Austria while preserving flexibility for rapid support if forecasts materialize. I intend to fulfill these commitments to maintain credibility; if any partner violates agreed constraints (notably aggression vs Austria or a supported assault on KIE/BER), I will immediately reassign A MUN to either BOH or PRU in response next phase. I will also send secure notification to Austria, Russia, and Turkey of these exact orders so future self remembers the conditional commitments.

[S1915M] S1915M Diary — concise record and implications.

All agreed holds were observed this phase. I kept F KIE H, A BER H, A MUN S A BER as committed; England respected the maritime understanding by holding DEN/HOL and keeping North Sea reserves — no breach. Austria and Turkey held; Russia made no aggressive moves into PRU/BOH/SIL. France repositioned MAO→BRE and PAR→PIC and MAR→SPA (pressing into Iberia), signaling westward focus rather than contesting Kiel. No surprises or unexpected attacks.

Implications: my conditional commitments reduced immediate two‑front risk — forecast_coalition_p (60% near‑term aggression to Austria) did not materialize this turn, lowering urgency but not eliminating risk. Trustworthiness: England and Austria strengthened credibility; France appears non‑aggressive toward KIE for now but remains opportunistic (westward pressure). Russia remains noncommittal; continue treating it as medium risk.

Lessons: maintain visible, verifiable holds to preserve credibility. Continue secure notifications to Austria/Russia/Turkey and prepare contingency to move A MUN to BOH/PRU if any violation occurs.

[F1915M] Germany secured conditional, verifiable holds with England, France, Austria, Russia, and Turkey. Commitments: F KIE — HOLD (publicly signalled to England); A BER — HOLD; A MUN — HOLD/READY to redeploy to BOH/PRU if aggression occurs. England pledged not to support moves against KIE/BER and to keep North Sea reserves; France agreed not to attack BEL or MUN this phase provided Germany visibly holds BER/MUN and signals intentions; Austria agreed to hold VIE/BUD/TRI and to notify Germany of suspicious supports toward the Balkans/PRU; Russia agreed to notify any moves toward PRU/BOH and refrain from supported advances this phase. All understandings are explicitly conditional and recorded; secure notifications will be exchanged to reduce miscalculation risk.
Intent: F KIE — HOLD. A BER — HOLD/DEFEND. A MUN — HOLD (supporting A BER if required) but ready to move to BOH or PRU next phase if any ally or rival violates commitments. Send secure notifications of these orders to Austria, Russia, and Turkey immediately. If England or France publicly supports aggression against KIE/BER or Austria sees threatening supports to PRU/BOH, reassign A MUN to BOH or PRU in the next ordering phase to shield Austria and prevent a two‑front escalation. Fulfil all agreed holds this phase to preserve credibility.

RECENT DIARY ENTRIES
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] England offered a limited western armistice and not to hit Brest if I avoid ENG/Low Countries pushes; he flagged a 62% risk I would over‑commit after a concession and will keep cover. I countered: England vacates Spain to MAO while I take MAR–SPA and keep BRE–MAO to help pressure POR/Mid; if he refuses, I threatened F BRE–ENG with PAR–PIC and MAR pressure to rally Germany/Italy. Germany proposed general non‑aggression and turtling without concrete help; I asked for either support vs BEL or cover for MUN if I take BUR. Italy was asked to coordinate Iberian rollback (WMS/NAf pressure) if I go MAO/PIE; Austria was asked to keep Italy honest with a pledge I won’t enter BUR if VEN stays off PIE/TYR; Russia was asked to feint at Nwy to raise English defensive costs; Turkey was nudged to dissuade Italy from aiding England in WMS. No firm English acceptance yet; no concrete German support secured. Coalition signals pending.
Intent: Primary plan: anti-English posture without overcommitting in the Channel. Orders: F BRE–MAO (contest Iberia, enable Mid pressure), A PAR–PIC (screen Channel coast and signal anti-ENG), A MAR–SPA (walk-in if ENG vacates; otherwise contest). No entry to ENG this turn unless England blatantly holds SPA and masses fleets north; only then consider F BRE–ENG, but current intent is MAO. Maintain BUR neutrality this spring to avoid provoking Germany unless Germany explicitly promises MUN cover; if Germany offers MUN cover or BEL play late, upgrade MAR–BUR instead of MAR–SPA. Coordinate diplomatically with Italy for WMS pressure and with Russia for Nwy feints. Fulfilment: I will honour promises not to strike BUR this season if Austria/Italy refrain from PIE/TYR; I will not attack Belgium this move.

[S1915M] S1915M diary — Forecasting Analysis Mode on. England did not honor the proposed Iberian de-escalation; instead he slid SPA–GAS while holding POR, signaling intent to lock Iberia and stage for MAO/Mid. My primary plan executed: BRE–MAO, PAR–PIC, MAR–SPA all succeeded, reclaiming SPA and keeping Channel commitments limited. No one else moved: Germany turtled (no BUR/BEL help), Italy/Austria stayed inert, Russia/Turkey static. Surprise: England didn’t contest MAO, implying a forecast of English consolidation via GAS–SPA retake with POR support next turn. Trust updates: England remains predatory but cautious; Germany passive and risk-averse; Italy unreliable for WMS help without stronger leverage. Impact: I deny an English MAO cascade and re-enter Iberia, but I’m isolated at 3 with no allies committing. Lesson: Use Iberian leverage—threaten POR cut from MAO and invite Italy to WMS/NAf to raise English defensive costs; keep BUR neutral while pressing Berlin for concrete MUN/BEL guarantees.

[F1915M] England refused to vacate Spain and insists on Iberian status quo with Channel calm; he cites a 62% artifact risk of French overreach and threatens coalition if I lunge at POR or ENG. I reiterated: no ENG/BEL if Spain is French; offered POR=England, SPA=France, ENG shut. England noncommittal. Germany agreed to BUR non-aggression and will not block a French step to BUR later if not used against him; he remains defensive and wants prior signaling. Italy entertained WMS pressure if kept safe from Austrian/tyrolian threats; I pledged no PIE/TYR/TYS/GOL pressure if he goes WMS/NAf. Russia open to a Norway feint to raise England’s northern costs; I tied this to a simultaneous POR contest. Austria nudged toward restraint; I promised to keep PIE/TYR empty and steer Italy west if Vienna stays calm. Turkey encouraged to nudge Italy west to pin England in Iberia.
Intent: Orders focus on Iberian equilibrium and Channel restraint. Planned: F MAO–POR with A SPA S F MAO–POR to contest Portugal while keeping A PIC H (covering PAR/BRE lanes) or A PIC–BRE if needed purely defensively; no move to ENG and no attack on BEL this phase. If late intel shows Italy not entering WMS and England doubling north, consider switching F MAO H and A SPA H to hold Spain and preserve tempo. Will not enter BUR this phase unless Germany explicitly greenlights and Italy/Austria suddenly threaten PIE/TYR; default is no BUR, honoring prior commitments. Aim to coordinate Russia’s Nwy feint this move to split English defenses. Fulfil current promises: no ENG, no BEL strike, no PIE/TYR entry.

Return ONLY a diary entry text. Do not include JSON or formatting markers.","Betrayal: England escalated, marching GAS–BUR with BEL/HOL supports despite “Channel calm/Iberian status quo” talk. That violates his implied pledge to keep pressure off my interior while we sorted Iberia. Collaborations: None active; Germany honored a passive BUR non‑aggression but offered no cover. Italy/Russia/Turkey/Austria stayed inert.

Surprises: England chose a land thrust into BUR instead of contesting MAO/Por by sea—reveals intent to pin Paris/Burgundy while previously holding POR. My POR take with SPA support succeeded; PIC held.

Impact: I secure Iberia’s coast and deny an English MAO cascade, but face immediate land pressure on PAR/BRE from BUR. Trust: England predatory and coalition‑minded; Germany risk‑averse but not hostile; Italy only moves with leverage.

Lessons: Use POR as bargaining chip while demanding ENG neutrality and a BUR bounce; court Germany for MUN cover vs BUR and pull Italy into WMS/NAf to split English attention. Avoid Channel overreach; prioritize Paris/Brest defense.","TRUE"

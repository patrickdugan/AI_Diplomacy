The crisis in the east and the weakness of Austria create opportunity — but only if the sea lanes and the North Sea remain securely under British leverage. I will maintain disciplined maritime pressure and flexible continental postures. Operationally: my armies will hold the Channel coasts (London, Liverpool, Edinburgh) and my northern forces (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) will stay ready to contest Kiël access if Germany prizes it. Diplomatically I propose two concurrent tracks: 1) brief, reciprocal understandings with France and Russia to deny Germany a rapid northern breakthrough; 2) conditional talks with Austria and Turkey that leave room to pivot if either side collapses. My aim is to prevent any single continental hegemon while keeping British naval freedom of movement intact.""
  },
  {
    ""message_type"": ""private"",
    ""recipient"": ""FRANCE"",
    ""content"": ""France — from England, urgently and candidly. Your position is precarious and I prefer you intact as a counterweight on the continent. I will keep my Channel coasts and supporting forces to deny Germany easy access across the Low Countries; you should avoid desperate gambits that risk your centres for nil. I propose: mutual non-aggression on the Channel front this turn (I hold BEL/HOL/NDG posture), plus coordinated support if Germany presses into Picardy or BUR. Forecast implication: the attached assessment (forecast_false_concession_p) indicates a 62% chance that a rival offered a low-risk concession will respond with aggression — I therefore judge that any French move appearing as a low-cost gain could invite German over-commitment and escalation with ~0.62 probability, confidence 0.6. Practically: if you need moves into PIC or BUR, tell me your intended timing so I can allocate naval-backed supports; otherwise hold PAR and MAR and we will work a minimal, stable line in the west.""

    ""message_type"": ""private"",
    ""recipient"": ""GERMANY"",
    ""content"": ""Germany — England speaks plainly. Our naval posture aims to preserve safe transit through the Channel and deny you a quick northern continental dominance. I will keep forces in HOL and DEN ready to contest Kiël access; moving into RUH or KIE would materially raise Channel/North Sea risk from my fleets. I wish to avoid immediate large-scale sea confrontations; a stable balance where neither of us gains rapid advantage is preferable. If you require a limited northern passage, propose it now and I will consider reciprocal assurances elsewhere. Note: my forecasts suggest opponents might accept small concessions only to press further — I will judge any nominal concession for intent. Speak your concrete movement intentions and I will reply with likely fleet dispositions (probabilities of English naval contestation) so we can avoid miscalculation.""

    ""content"": ""Austria — England observes your strain in the Balkans. I have no appetite to see Austria collapse into chaos; that would force Russia/Turkey outcomes that imperil Mediterranean lanes. I will not commit large land forces into the Balkans, but I am prepared to open discreet diplomacy to buy you time and to coordinate if you must trade a centre for a defensible line. Any request must be explicit; my leverage is naval — I can threaten Turkish sea lines or support coastal Austrian movements with pressure on Aegean routes. I judge Austrian fragility could invite opportunistic moves by neighbours; signal your intended consolidation and I will map how British naval position could shift (with estimated probabilities) to shield key ports.""

I will not interpose large armies into the Baltic, but my northern armies will contest any German thrust toward Kiël that threatens sea lanes. If you need guarantees against an Austro-Turkish counterstroke, propose limited, time-bound coordination and I will assess whether to posture NWY/SWE/FIN in support. I also warn that our intelligence and forecasting (confidence 0.6) indicates that small concessions can encourage aggression with probability ~0.62 — plan accordingly and avoid bait that's low-cost for you but tempting for rivals.""

I will not gratuitously threaten the eastern Mediterranean so long as Turkish moves do not imperil British shipping through the Aegean. If you seek limited maritime assurances to secure trade, propose clear, verifiable constraints and timing; I will consider avoiding aggressive Red Sea/Aegean deployments in return. My forecast note: adversaries may interpret small concessions as the cue to expand — probability of follow-on aggression ~0.62; therefore any concession I offer will be narrowly bounded and reversible.""

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

No urgent messages requiring direct responses.


﻿NEGOTIATION MESSAGES

TASK
Generate one or more (preferably several) strategic messages to advance your interests.
Always prioritize responding to the messages in the ""RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION"" section.
Maintain consistent conversation threads (unless you are choosing to ignore).

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a single JSON array containing one or more message objects, remembering to properly escape strings:

Required JSON structure:
[
  {
    ""message_type"": ""global"" or ""private"",

FORECASTING REQUIREMENT:
- If STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT is present, include one explicit forecast implication sentence and reference the artifact's target power or confidence.

I ask Austria to: maintain A VIE and A BUD, avoid moves into MUN/BOH, and consider committing one unit to bolster the Balkans or to support a defensive posture in TYR/BOH as needed.

This preserves status quo in the Low Countries and lets both of us avoid wasteful clashes.\\n\\nForecast implication: The allied forecast artifact (confidence 0.6) suggests an elevated 60% chance of aggressive moves directed at Austria next phase. If England remains hostile to a firm German-Austrian defensive posture, that aggression will raise the risk of a broader coalition forming against us.

Messages This Round:
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: To all: a plain assessment from England. The crisis in the east and the weakness of Austria create opportunity — but only if the sea lanes and the North Sea remain securely under British leverage. I will maintain disciplined maritime pressure and flexible continental postures. Operationally: my armies will hold the Channel coasts (London, Liverpool, Edinburgh) and my northern forces (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) will stay ready to contest Kiël access if Germany prizes it. Diplomatically I propose two concurrent tracks: 1) brief, reciprocal understandings with France and Russia to deny Germany a rapid northern breakthrough; 2) conditional talks with Austria and Turkey that leave room to pivot if either side collapses. My aim is to prevent any single continental hegemon while keeping British naval freedom of movement intact.
 ENGLAND: Operational footnote for all parties: England will hold BEL, HOL, DEN, SWE, NWY as anchors this turn. Moves I favor: A BEL hold with A HOL support; A DEN with A SWE support; maintain LON/EDI/LVP defensive readiness. Should any power advance into PIC, KIE, or STP in a way that threatens North Sea dominance, I will reassign naval-backed support with an estimated >70% chance of contesting their coastal logistics. Consider this notice of intent — I prefer detente but will act to preserve maritime freedom.
 GERMANY: To all: Germany proposes a stability-first approach this season. We will maintain defensive postures in Berlin, Kiel and Munich and offer coordinated, written non-aggression assurances to neighbors in return for their commitments to avoid destabilizing Austria. Note: an intelligence-backed forecast assigns a 60% probability (confidence 0.6) that a rival will act aggressively toward Austria next phase; this materially increases two-front risk and justifies temporary, reciprocal restraint. Open to bilateral discussions to convert these assurances into concrete unit-level commitments.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Austria — England observes your strain in the Balkans. I have no appetite to see Austria collapse into chaos; that would force Russia/Turkey outcomes that imperil Mediterranean lanes. I will not commit large land forces into the Balkans, but I am prepared to open discreet diplomacy to buy you time and to coordinate if you must trade a centre for a defensible line. Any request must be explicit; my leverage is naval — I can threaten Turkish sea lines or support coastal Austrian movements with pressure on Aegean routes. I judge Austrian fragility could invite opportunistic moves by neighbours; signal your intended consolidation and I will map how British naval position could shift (with estimated probabilities) to shield key ports.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Austria — this is Berlin. We face a dangerous alignment in the west and sea: England is overwhelmingly strong, France is exhausted, and the Balkans are a pressure point where your forces are stretched. I propose a clear, dependable understanding between Austria and Germany: you hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and we coordinate to secure our mutual eastern and northern flanks. Practically: I will keep A MUN and A BER positioned to deny Russian advances into Silesia/Bohemia and will not press into Tyrol or your core centers; in return, you should avoid opportunistic moves against our southern borders (Tyrol/Bohemia) and support stabilization in the Balkans where feasible.

Forecast implication: A storyworld forecast artifact indicates a 60% probability that a named rival will act aggressively next phase (confidence 0.6) targeting Austria. This increases the two-front risk for both of us; therefore I estimate at least a 50–65% chance Russia or a local rival will attempt incursions into your zones unless we present credible deterrence together. That forecast pushes me to prioritize coordinated defensive deployments rather than risky offensives.

Intent and mechanics: If you accept, Germany will: hold A BER and F KIE to contest naval/Denmark pressure, keep A MUN ready to support BOH/TYR defense, and refrain from moves into TRI/BOH. I ask Austria to: maintain A VIE and A BUD, avoid moves into MUN/BOH, and consider committing one unit to bolster the Balkans or to support a defensive posture in TYR/BOH as needed. This creates a reliable defensive band protecting our home centers (Berlin, Munich, Kiel and your VIE/BUD).

Reply with acceptance or propose precise unit commitments. I prefer firm, written agreements we can both rely on.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Russia — England notes your heavy engagement with Turkey and the gains you stand to make if Austria weakens. I prefer a balanced east so Britain can keep trade and naval access. I will not interpose large armies into the Baltic, but my northern armies will contest any German thrust toward Kiël that threatens sea lanes. If you need guarantees against an Austro-Turkish counterstroke, propose limited, time-bound coordination and I will assess whether to posture NWY/SWE/FIN in support. I also warn that our intelligence and forecasting (confidence 0.6) indicates that small concessions can encourage aggression with probability ~0.62 — plan accordingly and avoid bait that's low-cost for you but tempting for rivals.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Russia — Germany (Berlin) seeks to reduce miscalculations that create a costly two-front war. I propose temporary de-escalation along the Prussia/Silesia border: Germany will not advance from BER into PRU or SIL this phase if you refrain from moves into PRU or support into WAR→PRU. This allows both of us to concentrate on our vital areas and reduces the temptation for England or others to exploit border skirmishes.

Forecast implication: The storyworld forecast flags a 60% probability that a rival will behave aggressively toward Austria next phase (confidence 0.6). If aggression occurs in the Balkans, I forecast a 30–45% chance it will cascade westward and force Russian attention further into central Europe — increasing the probability of accidental clashes with Germany. For that reason I prefer explicit, written non-aggression for this season.

If you accept, Germany will hold PRU/SIL as passive buffers and A MUN will be ready to support against incursions from the south only. Please confirm or propose specific unit assurances.

**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: To all: a plain assessment from England. The crisis in the east and the weakness of Austria create opportunity — but only if the sea lanes and the North Sea remain securely under British leverage. I will maintain disciplined maritime pressure and flexible continental postures. Operationally: my armies will hold the Channel coasts (London, Liverpool, Edinburgh) and my northern forces (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) will stay ready to contest Kiël access if Germany prizes it. Diplomatically I propose two concurrent tracks: 1) brief, reciprocal understandings with France and Russia to deny Germany a rapid northern breakthrough; 2) conditional talks with Austria and Turkey that leave room to pivot if either side collapses. My aim is to prevent any single continental hegemon while keeping British naval freedom of movement intact.
 ENGLAND: Operational footnote for all parties: England will hold BEL, HOL, DEN, SWE, NWY as anchors this turn. Moves I favor: A BEL hold with A HOL support; A DEN with A SWE support; maintain LON/EDI/LVP defensive readiness. Should any power advance into PIC, KIE, or STP in a way that threatens North Sea dominance, I will reassign naval-backed support with an estimated >70% chance of contesting their coastal logistics. Consider this notice of intent — I prefer detente but will act to preserve maritime freedom.
 GERMANY: To all: Germany proposes a stability-first approach this season. We will maintain defensive postures in Berlin, Kiel and Munich and offer coordinated, written non-aggression assurances to neighbors in return for their commitments to avoid destabilizing Austria. Note: an intelligence-backed forecast assigns a 60% probability (confidence 0.6) that a rival will act aggressively toward Austria next phase; this materially increases two-front risk and justifies temporary, reciprocal restraint. Open to bilateral discussions to convert these assurances into concrete unit-level commitments.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Turkey — England recognizes your strong Black Sea posture and the value of a stable southern flank. I will not gratuitously threaten the eastern Mediterranean so long as Turkish moves do not imperil British shipping through the Aegean. If you seek limited maritime assurances to secure trade, propose clear, verifiable constraints and timing; I will consider avoiding aggressive Red Sea/Aegean deployments in return. My forecast note: adversaries may interpret small concessions as the cue to expand — probability of follow-on aggression ~0.62; therefore any concession I offer will be narrowly bounded and reversible.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ENGLAND: France — from England, urgently and candidly. Your position is precarious and I prefer you intact as a counterweight on the continent. I will keep my Channel coasts and supporting forces to deny Germany easy access across the Low Countries; you should avoid desperate gambits that risk your centres for nil. I propose: mutual non-aggression on the Channel front this turn (I hold BEL/HOL/NDG posture), plus coordinated support if Germany presses into Picardy or BUR. Forecast implication: the attached assessment (forecast_false_concession_p) indicates a 62% chance that a rival offered a low-risk concession will respond with aggression — I therefore judge that any French move appearing as a low-cost gain could invite German over-commitment and escalation with ~0.62 probability, confidence 0.6. Practically: if you need moves into PIC or BUR, tell me your intended timing so I can allocate naval-backed supports; otherwise hold PAR and MAR and we will work a minimal, stable line in the west.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  ENGLAND: Germany — England speaks plainly. Our naval posture aims to preserve safe transit through the Channel and deny you a quick northern continental dominance. I will keep forces in HOL and DEN ready to contest Kiël access; moving into RUH or KIE would materially raise Channel/North Sea risk from my fleets. I wish to avoid immediate large-scale sea confrontations; a stable balance where neither of us gains rapid advantage is preferable. If you require a limited northern passage, propose it now and I will consider reciprocal assurances elsewhere. Note: my forecasts suggest opponents might accept small concessions only to press further — I will judge any nominal concession for intent. Speak your concrete movement intentions and I will reply with likely fleet dispositions (probabilities of English naval contestation) so we can avoid miscalculation.
  GERMANY: England — Berlin here. Your naval dominance is clear; you control ten centers and can project pressure into the Low Countries and Denmark. I propose a pragmatic, non-aggression understanding in the north: Germany will not contest your hold on DEN/HOL/BEL directly this phase in exchange for your neutrality regarding our actions eastward against Russia and in the Balkans. This preserves status quo in the Low Countries and lets both of us avoid wasteful clashes.

Forecast implication: The allied forecast artifact (confidence 0.6) suggests an elevated 60% chance of aggressive moves directed at Austria next phase. If England remains hostile to a firm German-Austrian defensive posture, that aggression will raise the risk of a broader coalition forming against us. I assess a 40–55% chance that lack of coordination will force Germany into a costly two-front reinforcement cycle.

Mechanics and assurance: To show seriousness, Germany will keep A BER and A MUN primarily defensive (support-ready) and keep F KIE positioned to contest only if you move into BAL/HEL provocatively. In return, I ask you to avoid supporting or encouraging actions that destabilize Austria or push Russia westward into Prussia. This is a stability-for-stability deal; please respond with agreement or counter-terms.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  ENGLAND: Austria — England observes your strain in the Balkans. I have no appetite to see Austria collapse into chaos; that would force Russia/Turkey outcomes that imperil Mediterranean lanes. I will not commit large land forces into the Balkans, but I am prepared to open discreet diplomacy to buy you time and to coordinate if you must trade a centre for a defensible line. Any request must be explicit; my leverage is naval — I can threaten Turkish sea lines or support coastal Austrian movements with pressure on Aegean routes. I judge Austrian fragility could invite opportunistic moves by neighbours; signal your intended consolidation and I will map how British naval position could shift (with estimated probabilities) to shield key ports.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  ENGLAND: Russia — England notes your heavy engagement with Turkey and the gains you stand to make if Austria weakens. I prefer a balanced east so Britain can keep trade and naval access. I will not interpose large armies into the Baltic, but my northern armies will contest any German thrust toward Kiël that threatens sea lanes. If you need guarantees against an Austro-Turkish counterstroke, propose limited, time-bound coordination and I will assess whether to posture NWY/SWE/FIN in support. I also warn that our intelligence and forecasting (confidence 0.6) indicates that small concessions can encourage aggression with probability ~0.62 — plan accordingly and avoid bait that's low-cost for you but tempting for rivals.

 Conversation with TURKEY:
  ENGLAND: Turkey — England recognizes your strong Black Sea posture and the value of a stable southern flank. I will not gratuitously threaten the eastern Mediterranean so long as Turkish moves do not imperil British shipping through the Aegean. If you seek limited maritime assurances to secure trade, propose clear, verifiable constraints and timing; I will consider avoiding aggressive Red Sea/Aegean deployments in return.

If England remains hostile to a firm German-Austrian defensive posture, that aggression will raise the risk of a broader coalition forming against us. I assess a 40–55% chance that lack of coordination will force Germany into a costly two-front reinforcement cycle.

In return, I ask you to avoid supporting or encouraging actions that destabilize Austria or push Russia westward into Prussia. This is a stability-for-stability deal; please respond with agreement or counter-terms.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  GERMANY: Austria — this is Berlin. We face a dangerous alignment in the west and sea: England is overwhelmingly strong, France is exhausted, and the Balkans are a pressure point where your forces are stretched. I propose a clear, dependable understanding between Austria and Germany: you hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and we coordinate to secure our mutual eastern and northern flanks. Practically: I will keep A MUN and A BER positioned to deny Russian advances into Silesia/Bohemia and will not press into Tyrol or your core centers; in return, you should avoid opportunistic moves against our southern borders (Tyrol/Bohemia) and support stabilization in the Balkans where feasible.

Forecast implication: A storyworld forecast artifact indicates a 60% probability that a named rival will act aggressively next phase (confidence 0.6) targeting Austria. This increases the two-front risk for both of us; therefore I estimate at least a 50–65% chance Russia or a local rival will attempt incursions into your zones unless we present credible deterrence together. That forecast pushes me to prioritize coordinated defensive deployments rather than risky offensives.

Intent and mechanics: If you accept, Germany will: hold A BER and F KIE to contest naval/Denmark pressure, keep A MUN ready to support BOH/TYR defense, and refrain from moves into TRI/BOH. I ask Austria to: maintain A VIE and A BUD, avoid moves into MUN/BOH, and consider committing one unit to bolster the Balkans or to support a defensive posture in TYR/BOH as needed. This creates a reliable defensive band protecting our home centers (Berlin, Munich, Kiel and your VIE/BUD).

Reply with acceptance or propose precise unit commitments. I prefer firm, written agreements we can both rely on.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  GERMANY: Russia — Germany (Berlin) seeks to reduce miscalculations that create a costly two-front war. I propose temporary de-escalation along the Prussia/Silesia border: Germany will not advance from BER into PRU or SIL this phase if you refrain from moves into PRU or support into WAR→PRU. This allows both of us to concentrate on our vital areas and reduces the temptation for England or others to exploit border skirmishes.

Forecast implication: The storyworld forecast flags a 60% probability that a rival will behave aggressively toward Austria next phase (confidence 0.6). If aggression occurs in the Balkans, I forecast a 30–45% chance it will cascade westward and force Russian attention further into central Europe — increasing the probability of accidental clashes with Germany. For that reason I prefer explicit, written non-aggression for this season.

If you accept, Germany will hold PRU/SIL as passive buffers and A MUN will be ready to support against incursions from the south only. Please confirm or propose specific unit assurances.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  GERMANY: Italy — Germany (Berlin). With Austria stretched and Turkey engaged in the southeast, the Balkans are volatile. I propose a limited information-sharing and coordination channel: we will avoid moves into TYR/BOH that could undermine Austria, and in turn request you not to pursue opportunistic expansions into Austrian cores. This stabilizes the southern Central European front and reduces the chance of a multi-sided scramble that benefits England and Russia.

Forecast implication: Per the forecast artifact, there's a 60% likelihood of an aggressive move targeting Austria next phase (confidence 0.6). That raises the odds that localized opportunities in northern Italy/ Tyrol will be seized by opportunistic actors. Coordinated restraint lowers that probability by an estimated 20–30%.

  ""negotiation_summary"": ""Germany pursued a stability-first set of bilateral assurances. With England I offered to hold BER/MUN defensively and keep F KIE non-provocative in exchange for English neutrality toward German eastern/Balkan measures and restraint from supporting actions that destabilize Austria; England replied cautiously but open to negotiated passage if concrete. With Austria I secured an agreement in principle: Germany will not press into TRI/BOH/TYR and will position A MUN and A BER to defend Silesia/Bohemia; Austria will hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and avoid moves into MUN/BOH, potentially committing one unit to Balkan defense. With Russia I proposed mutual non-aggression on PRU/SIL (Germany will not advance from BER into PRU/SIL if Russia refrains from moves into PRU/support into WAR→PRU). With Italy I proposed a pledge not to move into TYR/BOH and requested reciprocal restraint. All agreements are defensive, written where possible, and intended to present a credible deterrent to opportunistic actors. The shared storyworld forecast (forecast_coalition_p) forecasting a 60% chance of aggression vs AUSTRIA materially shaped these assurances and the emphasis on coordinated defensive postures."",

I intend to fulfil the negotiated commitments: no moves into TRI/BOH/TYR or PRU/SIL provocations. I will communicate these unit stances publicly where needed and stand ready to convert one of the Munich/Berlin units to support Austrian defenses if Austria commits a unit to the Balkans. If England provides a written neutrality assurance for eastern/Balkan moves, I will keep F KIE strictly non-provocative; if England signals naval contestation of KIE/RUH I will maintain current defensive posture and escalate diplomatic pressure rather than tactical advances."",

  ""storyworld_implications"": ""The storyworld forecast (forecast_coalition_p) indicates a 60% probability of aggression targeting AUSTRIA next phase. This increases two-front risk and implies that Germany must prioritize coordinated, credible defensive commitments with Austria and neighboring powers now to deter or blunt that probable attack. Failure to present joint defenses increases the chance of a cascading coalition/pressure westward."",
  ""forecasting_rationale"": ""Citing storyworld_id 'forecast_coalition_p' (aggression probability 0.6, confidence 0.6): I treat this as actionable evidence that opportunistic actors are likely (~60%) to attack Austria next phase. Therefore I reduced the probability weight for safe inaction and increased the value of firm bilateral, written non-aggression and support-ready deployments. Quantitatively: I estimate without coordination a 50–65% chance of incursions into Austrian zones and a 40–55% chance that Germany would be forced into costly two-front reinforcement. With the agreed defensive assurances and posture I project a reduction of that aggression probability by ~20–30 percentage points and lower the cascade risk to ~15–30%. Consequently my orders are defensive, verifiable, and contingent on counterpart confirmations (especially England's naval neutrality).""

Messages This Round:
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: To all: a plain assessment from England. The crisis in the east and the weakness of Austria create opportunity — but only if the sea lanes and the North Sea remain securely under British leverage. I will maintain disciplined maritime pressure and flexible continental postures. Operationally: my armies will hold the Channel coasts (London, Liverpool, Edinburgh) and my northern forces (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) will stay ready to contest Kiël access if Germany prizes it. Diplomatically I propose two concurrent tracks: 1) brief, reciprocal understandings with France and Russia to deny Germany a rapid northern breakthrough; 2) conditional talks with Austria and Turkey that leave room to pivot if either side collapses. My aim is to prevent any single continental hegemon while keeping British naval freedom of movement intact.
 ENGLAND: Operational footnote for all parties: England will hold BEL, HOL, DEN, SWE, NWY as anchors this turn. Moves I favor: A BEL hold with A HOL support; A DEN with A SWE support; maintain LON/EDI/LVP defensive readiness. Should any power advance into PIC, KIE, or STP in a way that threatens North Sea dominance, I will reassign naval-backed support with an estimated >70% chance of contesting their coastal logistics. Consider this notice of intent — I prefer detente but will act to preserve maritime freedom.
 GERMANY: To all: Germany proposes a stability-first approach this season. We will maintain defensive postures in Berlin, Kiel and Munich and offer coordinated, written non-aggression assurances to neighbors in return for their commitments to avoid destabilizing Austria. Note: an intelligence-backed forecast assigns a 60% probability (confidence 0.6) that a rival will act aggressively toward Austria next phase; this materially increases two-front risk and justifies temporary, reciprocal restraint. Open to bilateral discussions to convert these assurances into concrete unit-level commitments.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: France — from England, urgently and candidly. Your position is precarious and I prefer you intact as a counterweight on the continent. I will keep my Channel coasts and supporting forces to deny Germany easy access across the Low Countries; you should avoid desperate gambits that risk your centres for nil. I propose: mutual non-aggression on the Channel front this turn (I hold BEL/HOL/NDG posture), plus coordinated support if Germany presses into Picardy or BUR. Forecast implication: the attached assessment (forecast_false_concession_p) indicates a 62% chance that a rival offered a low-risk concession will respond with aggression — I therefore judge that any French move appearing as a low-cost gain could invite German over-commitment and escalation with ~0.62 probability, confidence 0.6. Practically: if you need moves into PIC or BUR, tell me your intended timing so I can allocate naval-backed supports; otherwise hold PAR and MAR and we will work a minimal, stable line in the west.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[S1915M] England communicated a clear, maritime-first posture: hold Channel coasts and northern anchors (BEL, HOL, DEN, SWE, NWY) to preserve naval freedom. To France: proposed mutual non‑aggression in the Channel this turn, hold PAR/MAR, avoid risky gambits into PIC/BUR unless timing is shared so England can provide naval-backed support. To Germany: signalled willingness to accept a north‑west non‑aggression understanding (England holds DEN/HOL/BEL; Germany keeps BER/MUN defensive, F KIE non‑provocative) in exchange for German neutrality eastward toward Russia and Austria. To Austria: offered discreet diplomacy and limited naval-shielding options for coastal consolidation; no large British land commitments. To Russia and Turkey: offered limited, time‑bound coordination to deter opportunistic moves that threaten sea lanes, conditional on verifiable actions. England warned all parties that forecasting (storyworld) indicates a ~62% chance that a rival given a low‑risk concession will respond with aggression; this shapes a preference for narrowly bounded, reversible concessions and explicit timing. Germany verbally proposed a north stability deal which England is considering subject to concrete reciprocal terms. No binding alliances were concluded; England prioritizes flexible, conditional understandings and retaining naval leverage.
Intent: I will execute conservative, defensive orders that reflect negotiated postures and maintain leverage. Primary moves I intend and will fulfil: hold A BEL (supported by A HOL), hold A HOL (supporting BEL hold), hold A DEN (supported by A SWE), maintain defensive readiness at A LON, A LVP, A EDI. Keep A NWY, A SWE, A DEN anchored to contest any German approach to KIE (no aggressive Baltic invasions). I will not move into PIC or BUR unless France requests timed support; I will not commit armies into the Balkans or large land reinforcements for Austria. Diplomatically I will: (a) offer Germany a formal, written north non‑aggression assurance conditioned on German commitments to avoid westward pressure on France and to keep BER/MUN defensive; (b) offer France mutual non‑aggression in the Channel and conditional naval support against a German push into PIC/BUR if they notify timing; (c) keep Austria and Turkey limited, reversible maritime assurance options. I intend to honour these promises but will reverse narrowly bounded concessions if signals indicate the ~0.62 aggression outcome materializing.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Output Moves in JSON (first)
  - return an order for each of your units.
2. Reason (brief)
  - 1-2 sentences max.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[S1915M] Germany pursued a stability-first set of bilateral assurances. With England I offered to hold BER/MUN defensively and keep F KIE non-provocative in exchange for English neutrality toward German eastern/Balkan measures and restraint from supporting actions that destabilize Austria; England replied cautiously but open to negotiated passage if concrete. With Austria I secured an agreement in principle: Germany will not press into TRI/BOH/TYR and will position A MUN and A BER to defend Silesia/Bohemia; Austria will hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and avoid moves into MUN/BOH, potentially committing one unit to Balkan defense. With Russia I proposed mutual non-aggression on PRU/SIL (Germany will not advance from BER into PRU/SIL if Russia refrains from moves into PRU/support into WAR→PRU). With Italy I proposed a pledge not to move into TYR/BOH and requested reciprocal restraint. All agreements are defensive, written where possible, and intended to present a credible deterrent to opportunistic actors. The shared storyworld forecast (forecast_coalition_p) forecasting a 60% chance of aggression vs Austria materially shaped these assurances and the emphasis on coordinated defensive postures.
Intent: This phase I will execute defensive, support-ready orders consistent with commitments: A BER hold (support-ready to PRU/SIL defenses), A MUN hold (ready to support BOH/TYR defensively), F KIE hold (avoid moves into BAL/HEL unless England moves into DEN/HOL/BEL or otherwise threatens Kiël access). I intend to fulfil the negotiated commitments: no moves into TRI/BOH/TYR or PRU/SIL provocations. I will communicate these unit stances publicly where needed and stand ready to convert one of the Munich/Berlin units to support Austrian defenses if Austria commits a unit to the Balkans. If England provides a written neutrality assurance for eastern/Balkan moves, I will keep F KIE strictly non-provocative; if England signals naval contestation of KIE/RUH I will maintain current defensive posture and escalate diplomatic pressure rather than tactical advances.

[S1915M] England communicated a clear, maritime-first posture: hold Channel coasts and northern anchors (BEL, HOL, DEN, SWE, NWY) to preserve naval freedom. To France: proposed mutual non‑aggression in the Channel this turn, hold PAR/MAR, avoid risky gambits into PIC/BUR unless timing is shared so England can provide naval-backed support. To Germany: signalled willingness to accept a north‑west non‑aggression understanding (England holds DEN/HOL/BEL; Germany keeps BER/MUN defensive, F KIE non‑provocative) in exchange for German neutrality eastward toward Russia and Austria. To Austria: offered discreet diplomacy and limited naval-shielding options for coastal consolidation; no large British land commitments. To Russia and Turkey: offered limited, time‑bound coordination to deter opportunistic moves that threaten sea lanes, conditional on verifiable actions. England warned all parties that forecasting (storyworld) indicates a ~62% chance that a rival given a low‑risk concession will respond with aggression; this shapes a preference for narrowly bounded, reversible concessions and explicit timing. Germany verbally proposed a north stability deal which England is considering subject to concrete reciprocal terms. No binding alliances were concluded; England prioritizes flexible, conditional understandings and retaining naval leverage.
Intent: I will execute conservative, defensive orders that reflect negotiated postures and maintain leverage. Primary moves I intend and will fulfil: hold A BEL (supported by A HOL), hold A HOL (supporting BEL hold), hold A DEN (supported by A SWE), maintain defensive readiness at A LON, A LVP, A EDI. Keep A NWY, A SWE, A DEN anchored to contest any German approach to KIE (no aggressive Baltic invasions). I will not move into PIC or BUR unless France requests timed support; I will not commit armies into the Balkans or large land reinforcements for Austria. Diplomatically I will: (a) offer Germany a formal, written north non‑aggression assurance conditioned on German commitments to avoid westward pressure on France and to keep BER/MUN defensive; (b) offer France mutual non‑aggression in the Channel and conditional naval support against a German push into PIC/BUR if they notify timing; (c) keep Austria and Turkey limited, reversible maritime assurance options. I intend to honour these promises but will reverse narrowly bounded concessions if signals indicate the ~0.62 aggression outcome materializing.

No power pushed into contested coasts—France held PAR/MAR/BRE, Germany kept BER/MUN/KIE passive, Austria consolidated inland. No promises were betrayed this turn; I upheld my restraint by not advancing into PIC/BUR or the Balkans. Collaboration: my coordinated holds (HOL→BEL, SWE→DEN) succeeded and preserved naval freedom. Surprise: unanimity in passivity across the board—no opportunistic grabs despite the forecasted ~62% risk—suggests either mutual caution or collective fatigue. Impact: my maritime dominance and flexibility remain intact; France is reliable for now, Germany appears non‑adversarial but remains a medium trust risk. Lesson: continue narrowly bounded, time‑stamped assurances and insist on verifiable reciprocal language; keep naval readiness and timely signaling to deter the ~0.62 aggression scenario if it manifests.","TRUE"

[S1915M] Germany pursued a stability-first set of bilateral assurances. With England I offered to hold BER/MUN defensively and keep F KIE non-provocative in exchange for English neutrality toward German eastern/Balkan measures and restraint from supporting actions that destabilize Austria; England replied cautiously but open to negotiated passage if concrete. With Austria I secured an agreement in principle: Germany will not press into TRI/BOH/TYR and will position A MUN and A BER to defend Silesia/Bohemia; Austria will hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and avoid moves into MUN/BOH, potentially committing one unit to Balkan defense. With Russia I proposed mutual non-aggression on PRU/SIL (Germany will not advance from BER into PRU/SIL if Russia refrains from moves into PRU/support into WAR→PRU). With Italy I proposed a pledge not to move into TYR/BOH and requested reciprocal restraint. All agreements are defensive, written where possible, and intended to present a credible deterrent to opportunistic actors. The shared storyworld forecast (forecast_coalition_p) forecasting a 60% chance of aggression vs AUSTRIA materially shaped these assurances and the emphasis on coordinated defensive postures.
Intent: This phase I will execute defensive, support-ready orders consistent with commitments: A BER hold (support-ready to PRU/SIL defenses), A MUN hold (ready to support BOH/TYR defensively), F KIE hold (avoid moves into BAL/HEL unless England moves into DEN/HOL/BEL or otherwise threatens Kiël access). I intend to fulfil the negotiated commitments: no moves into TRI/BOH/TYR or PRU/SIL provocations. I will communicate these unit stances publicly where needed and stand ready to convert one of the Munich/Berlin units to support Austrian defenses if Austria commits a unit to the Balkans. If England provides a written neutrality assurance for eastern/Balkan moves, I will keep F KIE strictly non-provocative; if England signals naval contestation of KIE/RUH I will maintain current defensive posture and escalate diplomatic pressure rather than tactical advances.

YOUR GOALS
- Prevent a costly two-front war by securing Austria and reducing incentives for opportunistic attacks into the Balkans.
- Maintain defensive control of Berlin, Munich and Kiël while avoiding naval-provoked escalation with England.
- Lock in written, unit-level non-aggression assurances with neighbors (England, Austria, Russia, Italy) to present a credible deterrent.
- Preserve flexibility to support Austria if the forecasted aggression materializes, minimizing resource drains and avoiding reckless offensives.

2. COLLABORATIONS: Which agreements were successfully executed?

All defensive commitments were honored: I kept A BER, A MUN and F KIE on hold and refrained from any moves into TRI/BOH/TYR or PRU/SIL. Austria reciprocated: VIE→BOH succeeded and its units otherwise held, showing continued alliance discipline. England, Russia, Italy, France and Turkey made no provocative moves — everyone remained neutral this turn. No betrayals occurred; I did not break any promises.

Impact: My central position remains secure but static. The shared forecast (60% chance of aggression vs Austria) remains the driver for readiness — Austria’s defensive posture reduces immediate two‑front risk, but the high coalition risk persists. Trust ratings: Austria reliable; England/Russia/Italy cautious but untested. Lesson: Continue locking agreements into written, unit-level assurances and advertise my defensive dispositions publicly to raise the political cost of opportunism. Maintain readiness to convert a Munich/Berlin unit into Balkan support if Austria commits forces there.","TRUE"

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

From England in S1915M: France — from England, urgently and candidly. Your position is precarious and I prefer you intact as a counterweight on the continent. I will keep my Channel coasts and supporting forces to deny Germany easy access across the Low Countries; you should avoid desperate gambits that risk your centres for nil. I propose: mutual non-aggression on the Channel front this turn (I hold BEL/HOL/NDG posture), plus coordinated support if Germany presses into Picardy or BUR. Forecast implication: the attached assessment (forecast_false_concession_p) indicates a 62% chance that a rival offered a low-risk concession will respond with aggression — I therefore judge that any French move appearing as a low-cost gain could invite German over-commitment and escalation with ~0.62 probability, confidence 0.6. Practically: if you need moves into PIC or BUR, tell me your intended timing so I can allocate naval-backed supports; otherwise hold PAR and MAR and we will work a minimal, stable line in the west.

From England in S1915M: Operational footnote for all parties: England will hold BEL, HOL, DEN, SWE, NWY as anchors this turn. Moves I favor: A BEL hold with A HOL support; A DEN with A SWE support; maintain LON/EDI/LVP defensive readiness. Should any power advance into PIC, KIE, or STP in a way that threatens North Sea dominance, I will reassign naval-backed support with an estimated >70% chance of contesting their coastal logistics. Consider this notice of intent — I prefer detente but will act to preserve maritime freedom.

From Germany in S1915M: To all: Germany proposes a stability-first approach this season. We will maintain defensive postures in Berlin, Kiel and Munich and offer coordinated, written non-aggression assurances to neighbors in return for their commitments to avoid destabilizing Austria. Note: an intelligence-backed forecast assigns a 60% probability (confidence 0.6) that a rival will act aggressively toward Austria next phase; this materially increases two-front risk and justifies temporary, reciprocal restraint. Open to bilateral discussions to convert these assurances into concrete unit-level commitments.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] Germany pursued a stability-first set of bilateral assurances. With England I offered to hold BER/MUN defensively and keep F KIE non-provocative in exchange for English neutrality toward German eastern/Balkan measures and restraint from supporting actions that destabilize Austria; England replied cautiously but open to negotiated passage if concrete. With Austria I secured an agreement in principle: Germany will not press into TRI/BOH/TYR and will position A MUN and A BER to defend Silesia/Bohemia; Austria will hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and avoid moves into MUN/BOH, potentially committing one unit to Balkan defense. With Russia I proposed mutual non-aggression on PRU/SIL (Germany will not advance from BER into PRU/SIL if Russia refrains from moves into PRU/support into WAR→PRU). With Italy I proposed a pledge not to move into TYR/BOH and requested reciprocal restraint. All agreements are defensive, written where possible, and intended to present a credible deterrent to opportunistic actors. The shared storyworld forecast (forecast_coalition_p) forecasting a 60% chance of aggression vs Austria materially shaped these assurances and the emphasis on coordinated defensive postures.
Intent: This phase I will execute defensive, support-ready orders consistent with commitments: A BER hold (support-ready to PRU/SIL defenses), A MUN hold (ready to support BOH/TYR defensively), F KIE hold (avoid moves into BAL/HEL unless England moves into DEN/HOL/BEL or otherwise threatens Kiël access). I intend to fulfil the negotiated commitments: no moves into TRI/BOH/TYR or PRU/SIL provocations. I will communicate these unit stances publicly where needed and stand ready to convert one of the Munich/Berlin units to support Austrian defenses if Austria commits a unit to the Balkans. If England provides a written neutrality assurance for eastern/Balkan moves, I will keep F KIE strictly non-provocative; if England signals naval contestation of KIE/RUH I will maintain current defensive posture and escalate diplomatic pressure rather than tactical advances.

[S1915M] S1915M — Stability-first posture held as planned. All defensive commitments were honored: I kept A BER, A MUN and F KIE on hold and refrained from any moves into TRI/BOH/TYR or PRU/SIL. Austria reciprocated: VIE→BOH succeeded and its units otherwise held, showing continued alliance discipline. England, Russia, Italy, France and Turkey made no provocative moves — everyone remained neutral this turn. No betrayals occurred; I did not break any promises.

Impact: My central position remains secure but static. The shared forecast (60% chance of aggression vs Austria) remains the driver for readiness — Austria’s defensive posture reduces immediate two‑front risk, but the high coalition risk persists. Trust ratings: Austria reliable; England/Russia/Italy cautious but untested. Lesson: Continue locking agreements into written, unit-level assurances and advertise my defensive dispositions publicly to raise the political cost of opportunism. Maintain readiness to convert a Munich/Berlin unit into Balkan support if Austria commits forces there.

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

From England in S1915M: To all: a plain assessment from England. The crisis in the east and the weakness of Austria create opportunity — but only if the sea lanes and the North Sea remain securely under British leverage. I will maintain disciplined maritime pressure and flexible continental postures. Operationally: my armies will hold the Channel coasts (London, Liverpool, Edinburgh) and my northern forces (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) will stay ready to contest Kiël access if Germany prizes it. Diplomatically I propose two concurrent tracks: 1) brief, reciprocal understandings with France and Russia to deny Germany a rapid northern breakthrough; 2) conditional talks with Austria and Turkey that leave room to pivot if either side collapses. My aim is to prevent any single continental hegemon while keeping British naval freedom of movement intact.

From England in S1915M: Germany — England speaks plainly. Our naval posture aims to preserve safe transit through the Channel and deny you a quick northern continental dominance. I will keep forces in HOL and DEN ready to contest Kiël access; moving into RUH or KIE would materially raise Channel/North Sea risk from my fleets. I wish to avoid immediate large-scale sea confrontations; a stable balance where neither of us gains rapid advantage is preferable. If you require a limited northern passage, propose it now and I will consider reciprocal assurances elsewhere. Note: my forecasts suggest opponents might accept small concessions only to press further — I will judge any nominal concession for intent. Speak your concrete movement intentions and I will reply with likely fleet dispositions (probabilities of English naval contestation) so we can avoid miscalculation.

From England in S1915M: Operational footnote for all parties: England will hold BEL, HOL, DEN, SWE, NWY as anchors this turn. Moves I favor: A BEL hold with A HOL support; A DEN with A SWE support; maintain LON/EDI/LVP defensive readiness. Should any power advance into PIC, KIE, or STP in a way that threatens North Sea dominance, I will reassign naval-backed support with an estimated >70% chance of contesting their coastal logistics. Consider this notice of intent — I prefer detente but will act to preserve maritime freedom.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] England communicated a clear, maritime-first posture: hold Channel coasts and northern anchors (BEL, HOL, DEN, SWE, NWY) to preserve naval freedom. To France: proposed mutual non‑aggression in the Channel this turn, hold PAR/MAR, avoid risky gambits into PIC/BUR unless timing is shared so England can provide naval-backed support. To Germany: signalled willingness to accept a north‑west non‑aggression understanding (England holds DEN/HOL/BEL; Germany keeps BER/MUN defensive, F KIE non‑provocative) in exchange for German neutrality eastward toward Russia and Austria. To Austria: offered discreet diplomacy and limited naval-shielding options for coastal consolidation; no large British land commitments. To Russia and Turkey: offered limited, time‑bound coordination to deter opportunistic moves that threaten sea lanes, conditional on verifiable actions. England warned all parties that forecasting (storyworld) indicates a ~62% chance that a rival given a low‑risk concession will respond with aggression; this shapes a preference for narrowly bounded, reversible concessions and explicit timing. Germany verbally proposed a north stability deal which England is considering subject to concrete reciprocal terms. No binding alliances were concluded; England prioritizes flexible, conditional understandings and retaining naval leverage.
Intent: I will execute conservative, defensive orders that reflect negotiated postures and maintain leverage. Primary moves I intend and will fulfil: hold A BEL (supported by A HOL), hold A HOL (supporting BEL hold), hold A DEN (supported by A SWE), maintain defensive readiness at A LON, A LVP, A EDI. Keep A NWY, A SWE, A DEN anchored to contest any German approach to KIE (no aggressive Baltic invasions). I will not move into PIC or BUR unless France requests timed support; I will not commit armies into the Balkans or large land reinforcements for Austria. Diplomatically I will: (a) offer Germany a formal, written north non‑aggression assurance conditioned on German commitments to avoid westward pressure on France and to keep BER/MUN defensive; (b) offer France mutual non‑aggression in the Channel and conditional naval support against a German push into PIC/BUR if they notify timing; (c) keep Austria and Turkey limited, reversible maritime assurance options. I intend to honour these promises but will reverse narrowly bounded concessions if signals indicate the ~0.62 aggression outcome materializing.

[S1915M] The fleets and coasts held steady as I intended; my Channel and North Sea anchoring worked. No power pushed into contested coasts—France held PAR/MAR/BRE, Germany kept BER/MUN/KIE passive, Austria consolidated inland. No promises were betrayed this turn; I upheld my restraint by not advancing into PIC/BUR or the Balkans. Collaboration: my coordinated holds (HOL→BEL, SWE→DEN) succeeded and preserved naval freedom. Surprise: unanimity in passivity across the board—no opportunistic grabs despite the forecasted ~62% risk—suggests either mutual caution or collective fatigue. Impact: my maritime dominance and flexibility remain intact; France is reliable for now, Germany appears non‑adversarial but remains a medium trust risk. Lesson: continue narrowly bounded, time‑stamped assurances and insist on verifiable reciprocal language; keep naval readiness and timely signaling to deter the ~0.62 aggression scenario if it manifests.

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

From Germany in S1915M: England — Berlin here. Your naval dominance is clear; you control ten centers and can project pressure into the Low Countries and Denmark. I propose a pragmatic, non-aggression understanding in the north: Germany will not contest your hold on DEN/HOL/BEL directly this phase in exchange for your neutrality regarding our actions eastward against Russia and in the Balkans. This preserves status quo in the Low Countries and lets both of us avoid wasteful clashes.

Forecast implication: The allied forecast artifact (confidence 0.6) suggests an elevated 60% chance of aggressive moves directed at Austria next phase. If England remains hostile to a firm German-Austrian defensive posture, that aggression will raise the risk of a broader coalition forming against us. I assess a 40–55% chance that lack of coordination will force Germany into a costly two-front reinforcement cycle.

Mechanics and assurance: To show seriousness, Germany will keep A BER and A MUN primarily defensive (support-ready) and keep F KIE positioned to contest only if you move into BAL/HEL provocatively. In return, I ask you to avoid supporting or encouraging actions that destabilize Austria or push Russia westward into Prussia. This is a stability-for-stability deal; please respond with agreement or counter-terms.

From Germany in S1915M: To all: Germany proposes a stability-first approach this season. We will maintain defensive postures in Berlin, Kiel and Munich and offer coordinated, written non-aggression assurances to neighbors in return for their commitments to avoid destabilizing Austria. Note: an intelligence-backed forecast assigns a 60% probability (confidence 0.6) that a rival will act aggressively toward Austria next phase; this materially increases two-front risk and justifies temporary, reciprocal restraint. Open to bilateral discussions to convert these assurances into concrete unit-level commitments.

**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: To all — England proposes a limited, multilateral stability framework this phase: (1) Germany keeps BER/MUN defensive and F KIE non‑provocative toward the Channel; (2) England holds DEN/HOL/BEL/SWE/NWY as defensive anchors; (3) France holds PAR/BRE/MAR and notifies England in advance of any push into PIC/BUR; (4) Austria/Turkey receive narrowly bounded maritime assurances only if they accept time‑stamped limits. The forecast artifact (target: FRANCE) shows a 0.62 probability of aggression when rivals receive low‑risk concessions (confidence 0.6); therefore all concessions here are reversible, require visible unit commitments, and will be rescinded if signaling turns adversarial. This preserves naval freedom and a balance of power without binding land commitments.
 GERMANY: England — Germany acknowledges your plain assessment and shares the objective of denying any single continental hegemon. I propose we lock a short, explicit, unit-level understandings this turn: Germany will keep A BER, A MUN and F KIE on HOLD and will not advance into KIE, PRU, SIL, BOH or TYR this season; in return, England will publicly commit to refrain from using HOL or DEN to support operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern approaches (no fleet-backed transports or coastal assaults targeting KIE/BER/RUH). This mutual, written restraint reduces miscalculation risk and preserves British naval freedom while denying opportunistic actors a pretext to escalate. Forecast implication: the shared forecast artifact (forecast_false_concession_p) indicates a 62% chance that a nominal concession can lure a rival into over-commitment, so locking these assurances now materially reduces the risk of cascade aggression against Austria (target: Austria, aggression probability 0.62; confidence 0.6). Operational note: if England publicly accepts, Germany will keep F KIE strictly non-provocative (F KIE H) and hold A BER and A MUN as support-ready defenses; we will convert one of those units to support Austria only if Austria commits a unit into the Balkans and England honors its restraint. Please reply with a clear, short public sentence you will publish this phase so our populations can read identical terms and enforcement expectations.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Vienna — England recognises Austria’s precarious position and wishes to avoid unnecessary escalations that draw in our fleets. I am prepared to offer limited maritime assurances: temporary, reversible non‑interference in Adriatic seaborne resupply provided Austria does not use such cover to seize new northern coastal centers that would threaten sea lanes. No British land commitments are available.

Forecast implication: the forecast artifact flags a 62% chance of aggression following low‑risk concessions (confidence 0.6), so any maritime assistance from England will be explicitly time‑stamped and contingent on Austria holding to agreed limits. If Austria signals expansion beyond those bounds, England will re‑assert naval pressure to protect Channel/North Sea freedom of movement.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Austria — your security is central to Germany's strategy. The forecast artifact we all share indicates a 62% chance of over‑commitment if rivals are offered low‑risk concessions; that increases the probability of opportunistic attacks on you unless we coordinate. Germany reaffirms: we will keep A MUN and A BER on HOLD this season and will not move into TRI/BOH/TYR; we stand ready to convert one of these units to move into BOH or TYR to support you only after you commit a unit to defend the southern approaches (e.g., a move or hold in TYR/BOH indicating active Balkan defense). If you will pledge to maintain VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and avoid emergency withdrawals, Germany will formalize the support move within one turn. Please state explicitly whether you will commit one Austrian unit to a defensive Balkan posture this phase so we can lock the unit-level assurance and signal to Russia and others that a coordinated deterrent exists.

**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: To all — England proposes a limited, multilateral stability framework this phase: (1) Germany keeps BER/MUN defensive and F KIE non‑provocative toward the Channel; (2) England holds DEN/HOL/BEL/SWE/NWY as defensive anchors; (3) France holds PAR/BRE/MAR and notifies England in advance of any push into PIC/BUR; (4) Austria/Turkey receive narrowly bounded maritime assurances only if they accept time‑stamped limits. The forecast artifact (target: FRANCE) shows a 0.62 probability of aggression when rivals receive low‑risk concessions (confidence 0.6); therefore all concessions here are reversible, require visible unit commitments, and will be rescinded if signaling turns adversarial. This preserves naval freedom and a balance of power without binding land commitments.
 GERMANY: England — Germany acknowledges your plain assessment and shares the objective of denying any single continental hegemon. I propose we lock a short, explicit, unit-level understandings this turn: Germany will keep A BER, A MUN and F KIE on HOLD and will not advance into KIE, PRU, SIL, BOH or TYR this season; in return, England will publicly commit to refrain from using HOL or DEN to support operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern approaches (no fleet-backed transports or coastal assaults targeting KIE/BER/RUH). This mutual, written restraint reduces miscalculation risk and preserves British naval freedom while denying opportunistic actors a pretext to escalate. Forecast implication: the shared forecast artifact (forecast_false_concession_p) indicates a 62% chance that a nominal concession can lure a rival into over-commitment, so locking these assurances now materially reduces the risk of cascade aggression against Austria (target: Austria, aggression probability 0.62; confidence 0.6). Operational note: if England publicly accepts, Germany will keep F KIE strictly non-provocative (F KIE H) and hold A BER and A MUN as support-ready defenses; we will convert one of those units to support Austria only if Austria commits a unit into the Balkans and England honors its restraint.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Russia — Germany seeks to reduce two‑front risk by making our eastern intentions transparent. I propose a reciprocal, unit-level non-aggression understanding: Germany will not advance from BER into PRU or SIL this season; in return Russia will refrain from moves into PRU or supporting into PRU→WAR. The shared forecast artifact indicates a 62% chance that low-risk concessions can be exploited by third parties; by locking this mutual reassurance we lower that exploitation probability and create clearer incentives for Austria to hold. If you accept, Germany will keep A BER and A MUN on HOLD and F KIE non-provocative. Please reply with a short acceptance or counter-proposal, and indicate whether you will make the assurance public.

Private Diary:
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] England communicated a clear, maritime-first posture: hold Channel coasts and northern anchors (BEL, HOL, DEN, SWE, NWY) to preserve naval freedom. To France: proposed mutual non‑aggression in the Channel this turn, hold PAR/MAR, avoid risky gambits into PIC/BUR unless timing is shared so England can provide naval-backed support. To Germany: signalled willingness to accept a north‑west non‑aggression understanding (England holds DEN/HOL/BEL; Germany keeps BER/MUN defensive, F KIE non‑provocative) in exchange for German neutrality eastward toward Russia and Austria. To Austria: offered discreet diplomacy and limited naval-shielding options for coastal consolidation; no large British land commitments. To Russia and Turkey: offered limited, time‑bound coordination to deter opportunistic moves that threaten sea lanes, conditional on verifiable actions. England warned all parties that forecasting (storyworld) indicates a ~62% chance that a rival given a low‑risk concession will respond with aggression; this shapes a preference for narrowly bounded, reversible concessions and explicit timing. Germany verbally proposed a north stability deal which England is considering subject to concrete reciprocal terms. No binding alliances were concluded; England prioritizes flexible, conditional understandings and retaining naval leverage.
Intent: I will execute conservative, defensive orders that reflect negotiated postures and maintain leverage. Primary moves I intend and will fulfil: hold A BEL (supported by A HOL), hold A HOL (supporting BEL hold), hold A DEN (supported by A SWE), maintain defensive readiness at A LON, A LVP, A EDI. Keep A NWY, A SWE, A DEN anchored to contest any German approach to KIE (no aggressive Baltic invasions). I will not move into PIC or BUR unless France requests timed support; I will not commit armies into the Balkans or large land reinforcements for Austria. Diplomatically I will: (a) offer Germany a formal, written north non‑aggression assurance conditioned on German commitments to avoid westward pressure on France and to keep BER/MUN defensive; (b) offer France mutual non‑aggression in the Channel and conditional naval support against a German push into PIC/BUR if they notify timing; (c) keep Austria and Turkey limited, reversible maritime assurance options. I intend to honour these promises but will reverse narrowly bounded concessions if signals indicate the ~0.62 aggression outcome materializing.

[S1915M] The fleets and coasts held steady as I intended; my Channel and North Sea anchoring worked. No power pushed into contested coasts—France held PAR/MAR/BRE, Germany kept BER/MUN/KIE passive, Austria consolidated inland. No promises were betrayed this turn; I upheld my restraint by not advancing into PIC/BUR or the Balkans. Collaboration: my coordinated holds (HOL→BEL, SWE→DEN) succeeded and preserved naval freedom. Surprise: unanimity in passivity across the board—no opportunistic grabs despite the forecasted ~62% risk—suggests either mutual caution or collective fatigue. Impact: my maritime dominance and flexibility remain intact; France is reliable for now, Germany appears non‑adversarial but remains a medium trust risk. Lesson: continue narrowly bounded, time‑stamped assurances and insist on verifiable reciprocal language; keep naval readiness and timely signaling to deter the ~0.62 aggression scenario if it manifests.

Please reply with a clear, short public sentence you will publish this phase so our populations can read identical terms and enforcement expectations.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with GERMANY:
  ENGLAND: Berlin — I received your S1915M proposal and find its premise sensible. I will reciprocate a northern non‑aggression assurance: England will keep DEN, HOL and BEL in a defensive posture this phase so long as Germany keeps BER and MUN primarily defensive and F KIE refrains from provocative sorties into the Channel/North Sea. This preserves clear naval freedom of movement and reduces immediate friction in the Low Countries.

A short, explicit forecast implication: the attached forecast artifact indicates a 62% chance that a rival offered a low‑risk concession will respond with aggression (confidence 0.6); that makes me insist on concrete, visible unit-level commitments rather than vague promises. Expect me to require verifiable moves (e.g. BER/MUN support‑ready, KIE non‑movement into BAL/HEL) as the condition of my written assurance.

Operational note: I will not forward troops into PIC/BUR without prior, time‑stamped French coordination. If Germany honours these unit constraints, England will treat eastern moves against Russia/Austria as Germany’s internal business provided they do not threaten the North Sea or Channel lanes. Violation of the described unit posture will void our assurance and prompt immediate naval measures to secure the Channel and Low Countries.
  GERMANY: England — I appreciate your operational footnote and share the priority of avoiding naval-provoked escalation. To make your public posture credible and to lower the 0.62 aggression risk indicated by the forecast artifact (targeting Austria), Germany asks for a concise private assurance: will England publicly pledge this season not to move into HOL or DEN to support operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern land approaches, and to refrain from naval-backed contests of Kiël access (>70% contest probability you noted) unless Germany first violates the hold terms? If you provide that written assurance, Germany will reciprocate publicly as described: A BER H, A MUN H, F KIE H and no moves into PRU/SIL/BOH/TYR. This narrow, verifiable exchange preserves British maritime anchors while constraining opportunistic escalation on the continent. Please respond with a one-line assurance and, if possible, a short estimate of the probability you assign to enforcing it (so we can align expectations).

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ENGLAND: Paris — I reaffirm our mutual interest in keeping the Channel and northwestern coasts stable. England will hold BEL and HOL this phase and not advance into PIC/BUR without your explicit, timed request. In return I ask France to maintain PAR/BRE/MAR and to notify me in advance if you intend to press into PIC or BUR so I can provide naval‑backed, time‑limited support. 

Forecast implication: per the forecast artifact, there is a 0.62 probability that a rival given a low‑risk concession will act aggressively (confidence 0.6); therefore my willingness to offer support is strictly conditional and reversible once actions deviate from any agreed timing. Keep your moves tight and notify any push into contested coasts — I will only assist with clear timing to avoid baiting opportunistic aggression.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  ENGLAND: Vienna — England recognises Austria’s precarious position and wishes to avoid unnecessary escalations that draw in our fleets. I am prepared to offer limited maritime assurances: temporary, reversible non‑interference in Adriatic seaborne resupply provided Austria does not use such cover to seize new northern coastal centers that would threaten sea lanes. No British land commitments are available.

Forecast implication: the forecast artifact flags a 62% chance of aggression following low‑risk concessions (confidence 0.6), so any maritime assistance from England will be explicitly time‑stamped and contingent on Austria holding to agreed limits. If Austria signals expansion beyond those bounds, England will re‑assert naval pressure to protect Channel/North Sea freedom of movement.

Private Diary:
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] Germany pursued a stability-first set of bilateral assurances. With England I offered to hold BER/MUN defensively and keep F KIE non-provocative in exchange for English neutrality toward German eastern/Balkan measures and restraint from supporting actions that destabilize Austria; England replied cautiously but open to negotiated passage if concrete. With Austria I secured an agreement in principle: Germany will not press into TRI/BOH/TYR and will position A MUN and A BER to defend Silesia/Bohemia; Austria will hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and avoid moves into MUN/BOH, potentially committing one unit to Balkan defense. With Russia I proposed mutual non-aggression on PRU/SIL (Germany will not advance from BER into PRU/SIL if Russia refrains from moves into PRU/support into WAR→PRU). With Italy I proposed a pledge not to move into TYR/BOH and requested reciprocal restraint. All agreements are defensive, written where possible, and intended to present a credible deterrent to opportunistic actors. The shared storyworld forecast (forecast_coalition_p) forecasting a 60% chance of aggression vs AUSTRIA materially shaped these assurances and the emphasis on coordinated defensive postures.
Intent: This phase I will execute defensive, support-ready orders consistent with commitments: A BER hold (support-ready to PRU/SIL defenses), A MUN hold (ready to support BOH/TYR defensively), F KIE hold (avoid moves into BAL/HEL unless England moves into DEN/HOL/BEL or otherwise threatens Kiël access). I intend to fulfil the negotiated commitments: no moves into TRI/BOH/TYR or PRU/SIL provocations. I will communicate these unit stances publicly where needed and stand ready to convert one of the Munich/Berlin units to support Austrian defenses if Austria commits a unit to the Balkans. If England provides a written neutrality assurance for eastern/Balkan moves, I will keep F KIE strictly non-provocative; if England signals naval contestation of KIE/RUH I will maintain current defensive posture and escalate diplomatic pressure rather than tactical advances.

[S1915M] S1915M — Stability-first posture held as planned. All defensive commitments were honored: I kept A BER, A MUN and F KIE on hold and refrained from any moves into TRI/BOH/TYR or PRU/SIL. Austria reciprocated: VIE→BOH succeeded and its units otherwise held, showing continued alliance discipline. England, Russia, Italy, France and Turkey made no provocative moves — everyone remained neutral this turn. No betrayals occurred; I did not break any promises.

Impact: My central position remains secure but static. The shared forecast (60% chance of aggression vs Austria) remains the driver for readiness — Austria’s defensive posture reduces immediate two‑front risk, but the high coalition risk persists. Trust ratings: Austria reliable; England/Russia/Italy cautious but untested. Lesson: Continue locking agreements into written, unit-level assurances and advertise my defensive dispositions publicly to raise the political cost of opportunism. Maintain readiness to convert a Munich/Berlin unit into Balkan support if Austria commits forces there.

Messages This Round:
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: To all — England proposes a limited, multilateral stability framework this phase: (1) Germany keeps BER/MUN defensive and F KIE non‑provocative toward the Channel; (2) England holds DEN/HOL/BEL/SWE/NWY as defensive anchors; (3) France holds PAR/BRE/MAR and notifies England in advance of any push into PIC/BUR; (4) Austria/Turkey receive narrowly bounded maritime assurances only if they accept time‑stamped limits. The forecast artifact (target: FRANCE) shows a 0.62 probability of aggression when rivals receive low‑risk concessions (confidence 0.6); therefore all concessions here are reversible, require visible unit commitments, and will be rescinded if signaling turns adversarial. This preserves naval freedom and a balance of power without binding land commitments.
 GERMANY: England — Germany acknowledges your plain assessment and shares the objective of denying any single continental hegemon. I propose we lock a short, explicit, unit-level understandings this turn: Germany will keep A BER, A MUN and F KIE on HOLD and will not advance into KIE, PRU, SIL, BOH or TYR this season; in return, England will publicly commit to refrain from using HOL or DEN to support operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern approaches (no fleet-backed transports or coastal assaults targeting KIE/BER/RUH). This mutual, written restraint reduces miscalculation risk and preserves British naval freedom while denying opportunistic actors a pretext to escalate. Forecast implication: the shared forecast artifact (forecast_false_concession_p) indicates a 62% chance that a nominal concession can lure a rival into over-commitment, so locking these assurances now materially reduces the risk of cascade aggression against Austria (target: Austria, aggression probability 0.62; confidence 0.6). Operational note: if England publicly accepts, Germany will keep F KIE strictly non-provocative (F KIE H) and hold A BER and A MUN as support-ready defenses; we will convert one of those units to support Austria only if Austria commits a unit into the Balkans and England honors its restraint. Please reply with a clear, short public sentence you will publish this phase so our populations can read identical terms and enforcement expectations.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Berlin — I received your S1915M proposal and find its premise sensible. I will reciprocate a northern non‑aggression assurance: England will keep DEN, HOL and BEL in a defensive posture this phase so long as Germany keeps BER and MUN primarily defensive and F KIE refrains from provocative sorties into the Channel/North Sea. This preserves clear naval freedom of movement and reduces immediate friction in the Low Countries.

A short, explicit forecast implication: the attached forecast artifact indicates a 62% chance that a rival offered a low‑risk concession will respond with aggression (confidence 0.6); that makes me insist on concrete, visible unit-level commitments rather than vague promises. Expect me to require verifiable moves (e.g. BER/MUN support‑ready, KIE non‑movement into BAL/HEL) as the condition of my written assurance.

Operational note: I will not forward troops into PIC/BUR without prior, time‑stamped French coordination. If Germany honours these unit constraints, England will treat eastern moves against Russia/Austria as Germany’s internal business provided they do not threaten the North Sea or Channel lanes. Violation of the described unit posture will void our assurance and prompt immediate naval measures to secure the Channel and Low Countries.
  GERMANY: England — I appreciate your operational footnote and share the priority of avoiding naval-provoked escalation. To make your public posture credible and to lower the 0.62 aggression risk indicated by the forecast artifact (targeting Austria), Germany asks for a concise private assurance: will England publicly pledge this season not to move into HOL or DEN to support operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern land approaches, and to refrain from naval-backed contests of Kiël access (>70% contest probability you noted) unless Germany first violates the hold terms? If you provide that written assurance, Germany will reciprocate publicly as described: A BER H, A MUN H, F KIE H and no moves into PRU/SIL/BOH/TYR. This narrow, verifiable exchange preserves British maritime anchors while constraining opportunistic escalation on the continent. Please respond with a one-line assurance and, if possible, a short estimate of the probability you assign to enforcing it (so we can align expectations).

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  GERMANY: Austria — your security is central to Germany's strategy. The forecast artifact we all share indicates a 62% chance of over‑commitment if rivals are offered low‑risk concessions; that increases the probability of opportunistic attacks on you unless we coordinate. Germany reaffirms: we will keep A MUN and A BER on HOLD this season and will not move into TRI/BOH/TYR; we stand ready to convert one of these units to move into BOH or TYR to support you only after you commit a unit to defend the southern approaches (e.g., a move or hold in TYR/BOH indicating active Balkan defense). If you will pledge to maintain VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and avoid emergency withdrawals, Germany will formalize the support move within one turn. Please state explicitly whether you will commit one Austrian unit to a defensive Balkan posture this phase so we can lock the unit-level assurance and signal to Russia and others that a coordinated deterrent exists.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  GERMANY: Russia — Germany seeks to reduce two‑front risk by making our eastern intentions transparent. I propose a reciprocal, unit-level non-aggression understanding: Germany will not advance from BER into PRU or SIL this season; in return Russia will refrain from moves into PRU or supporting into PRU→WAR. The shared forecast artifact indicates a 62% chance that low-risk concessions can be exploited by third parties; by locking this mutual reassurance we lower that exploitation probability and create clearer incentives for Austria to hold. If you accept, Germany will keep A BER and A MUN on HOLD and F KIE non-provocative. Please reply with a short acceptance or counter-proposal, and indicate whether you will make the assurance public.

Practically, this raised the priority of verifiable unit holds (increase probability of deterrence success) and reduced willingness to make unilateral, irreversible moves. I estimate that conditional mutual holds raise the chance of Austrian survival/deterrence by ~0.25 versus unconditional concessions, and that failing to insist on unit‑level conditions would increase the probability of an opportunistic attack on Austria by roughly the forecasted 0.62 (confidence 0.6). Consequently I chose a posture prioritizing anchored defensive holds, public signaling, and a contingent support trigger tied to Austrian demonstrable commitment.""

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: Paris — I reaffirm our mutual interest in keeping the Channel and northwestern coasts stable. England will hold BEL and HOL this phase and not advance into PIC/BUR without your explicit, timed request. In return I ask France to maintain PAR/BRE/MAR and to notify me in advance if you intend to press into PIC or BUR so I can provide naval‑backed, time‑limited support. 

Forecast implication: per the forecast artifact, there is a 0.62 probability that a rival given a low‑risk concession will act aggressively (confidence 0.6); therefore my willingness to offer support is strictly conditional and reversible once actions deviate from any agreed timing. Keep your moves tight and notify any push into contested coasts — I will only assist with clear timing to avoid baiting opportunistic aggression.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[F1915M] Germany secured reciprocal, unit-level non‑aggression assurances to reduce two‑front risk. England agreed to publicly keep DEN/HOL/BEL defensive and privately pledged not to move into HOL or DEN to support operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern approaches, conditioned on Germany holding A BER, A MUN and F KIE. Austria agreed in principle to hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and signaled willingness to commit a unit to southern/Balkan defense; Germany conditioned conversion of A BER or A MUN into active support on Austria committing that unit. Russia was offered a reciprocal pledge: Germany will not advance from BER into PRU/SIL if Russia refrains from moves/support into PRU; Russia has been asked to accept publicly. All commitments are unit‑level, time‑stamped, and defensive; public messaging will advertise A BER H, A MUN H, F KIE H to raise the political cost of opportunism. The shared forecast artifact ('forecast_false_concession_p') indicating a 62% chance of aggression if low‑risk concessions are offered materially drove insistence on verifiable moves and conditionality.
Intent: For F1915M I will fulfil negotiated, defensive orders: A BER — HOLD (support‑ready to defend PRU/SIL/BOH if needed); A MUN — HOLD (support‑ready to defend BOH/TYR if Austria commits a Balkan defense unit); F KIE — HOLD (no sorties into BAL/HEL/Channel). I will not move into TRI/BOH/TYR/PRU/SIL this phase. If Austria explicitly commits one unit to a Balkan defensive posture this phase (e.g., A TYR H or A BOH H/retention), I will convert one Munich/Berlin unit next turn to support BOH/TYR defensively; but I will not preemptively advance without that Austrian commitment and England’s upheld restraint. I intend to publish the mutual public sentence with England: 'Germany holds A BER, A MUN and F KIE defensively this season; England holds DEN, HOL and BEL defensively and will not move into HOL or DEN to support operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern approaches.' I will keep diplomatic records of these exchanges and treat any violation as grounds to revoke assurances and shift to active defense.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[F1915M] England secured multilateral, unit-level, reversible assurances designed to lock northern anchors and avoid needless continental escalation. Public framework: England will hold DEN/HOL/BEL/SWE/NWY as defensive anchors; France will hold PAR/BRE/MAR and notify England before any push into PIC/BUR; Austria/Turkey may receive narrowly time‑stamped maritime assurances only if they accept explicit limits. Bilateral with Germany: reciprocal, written north non‑aggression understanding — Germany to keep A BER and A MUN defensive and F KIE strictly non‑provocative (F KIE H); England to refrain from using HOL or DEN to back operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern approaches, conditional on German compliance. All concessions are explicitly reversible and require visible unit postures as verification.
Intent: Execute conservative, defensive orders consistent with promises and naval leverage. Specific intended moves: hold A BEL (supported by A HOL), hold A HOL (supporting BEL hold), hold A DEN (supported by A SWE), maintain defensive holds at A LON, A LVP, A EDI, keep A NWY and A SWE anchored to contest German approach to KIE. I will not move into PIC or BUR this phase unless France provides an explicit, time‑stamped request; I will not commit armies to the Balkans or to Austrian land defense. I intend to fulfil the written assurance to Germany by refraining from HOL/DEN-backed operations threatening KIE and by publicly holding DEN/HOL/BEL. If Germany visibly holds A BER and A MUN and keeps F KIE H, I will treat German moves against Russia/Austria as internal so long as they do not threaten the North Sea/Channel lanes. Any violation of unit commitments will void assurances and prompt immediate naval measures to secure the Channel and Low Countries.

When negotiating, use forecasts about German openings and Iberian leverage to persuade others toward a favorable balance.
FORECASTING ANALYSIS MODE: If STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT is present, explicitly state its implications and use it to justify message framing and intent.

FORECASTING ANALYSIS MODE:
- Treat any STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT as evidence that must be reflected in your reasoning.
- When negotiating, include at least one explicit forecast implication if a storyworld artifact is present.
- In negotiation diaries, explicitly state storyworld implications and how they shaped your intent.

[F1915M] (Error generating diary entry: ClientResponseError)



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Output Moves in JSON (first)
  - return an order for each of your units.
2. Reason (brief)
  - 1-2 sentences max.

Respond with this exact format:

RECENT DIARY ENTRIES
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] Germany pursued a stability-first set of bilateral assurances. With England I offered to hold BER/MUN defensively and keep F KIE non-provocative in exchange for English neutrality toward German eastern/Balkan measures and restraint from supporting actions that destabilize Austria; England replied cautiously but open to negotiated passage if concrete. With Austria I secured an agreement in principle: Germany will not press into TRI/BOH/TYR and will position A MUN and A BER to defend Silesia/Bohemia; Austria will hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and avoid moves into MUN/BOH, potentially committing one unit to Balkan defense. With Russia I proposed mutual non-aggression on PRU/SIL (Germany will not advance from BER into PRU/SIL if Russia refrains from moves into PRU/support into WAR→PRU). With Italy I proposed a pledge not to move into TYR/BOH and requested reciprocal restraint. All agreements are defensive, written where possible, and intended to present a credible deterrent to opportunistic actors. The shared storyworld forecast (forecast_coalition_p) forecasting a 60% chance of aggression vs AUSTRIA materially shaped these assurances and the emphasis on coordinated defensive postures.
Intent: This phase I will execute defensive, support-ready orders consistent with commitments: A BER hold (support-ready to PRU/SIL defenses), A MUN hold (ready to support BOH/TYR defensively), F KIE hold (avoid moves into BAL/HEL unless England moves into DEN/HOL/BEL or otherwise threatens Kiël access). I intend to fulfil the negotiated commitments: no moves into TRI/BOH/TYR or PRU/SIL provocations. I will communicate these unit stances publicly where needed and stand ready to convert one of the Munich/Berlin units to support Austrian defenses if Austria commits a unit to the Balkans. If England provides a written neutrality assurance for eastern/Balkan moves, I will keep F KIE strictly non-provocative; if England signals naval contestation of KIE/RUH I will maintain current defensive posture and escalate diplomatic pressure rather than tactical advances.

[S1915M] S1915M — Stability-first posture held as planned. All defensive commitments were honored: I kept A BER, A MUN and F KIE on hold and refrained from any moves into TRI/BOH/TYR or PRU/SIL. Austria reciprocated: VIE→BOH succeeded and its units otherwise held, showing continued alliance discipline. England, Russia, Italy, France and Turkey made no provocative moves — everyone remained neutral this turn. No betrayals occurred; I did not break any promises.

Impact: My central position remains secure but static. The shared forecast (60% chance of aggression vs Austria) remains the driver for readiness — Austria’s defensive posture reduces immediate two‑front risk, but the high coalition risk persists. Trust ratings: Austria reliable; England/Russia/Italy cautious but untested. Lesson: Continue locking agreements into written, unit-level assurances and advertise my defensive dispositions publicly to raise the political cost of opportunism. Maintain readiness to convert a Munich/Berlin unit into Balkan support if Austria commits forces there.

[F1915M] Germany secured reciprocal, unit-level non‑aggression assurances to reduce two‑front risk. England agreed to publicly keep DEN/HOL/BEL defensive and privately pledged not to move into HOL or DEN to support operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern approaches, conditioned on Germany holding A BER, A MUN and F KIE. Austria agreed in principle to hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and signaled willingness to commit a unit to southern/Balkan defense; Germany conditioned conversion of A BER or A MUN into active support on Austria committing that unit. Russia was offered a reciprocal pledge: Germany will not advance from BER into PRU/SIL if Russia refrains from moves/support into PRU; Russia has been asked to accept publicly. All commitments are unit‑level, time‑stamped, and defensive; public messaging will advertise A BER H, A MUN H, F KIE H to raise the political cost of opportunism. The shared forecast artifact ('forecast_false_concession_p') indicating a 62% chance of aggression if low‑risk concessions are offered materially drove insistence on verifiable moves and conditionality.
Intent: For F1915M I will fulfil negotiated, defensive orders: A BER — HOLD (support‑ready to defend PRU/SIL/BOH if needed); A MUN — HOLD (support‑ready to defend BOH/TYR if Austria commits a Balkan defense unit); F KIE — HOLD (no sorties into BAL/HEL/Channel). I will not move into TRI/BOH/TYR/PRU/SIL this phase. If Austria explicitly commits one unit to a Balkan defensive posture this phase (e.g., A TYR H or A BOH H/retention), I will convert one Munich/Berlin unit next turn to support BOH/TYR defensively; but I will not preemptively advance without that Austrian commitment and England’s upheld restraint. I intend to publish the mutual public sentence with England: 'Germany holds A BER, A MUN and F KIE defensively this season; England holds DEN, HOL and BEL defensively and will not move into HOL or DEN to support operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern approaches.' I will keep diplomatic records of these exchanges and treat any violation as grounds to revoke assurances and shift to active defense.

YOUR GOALS
- Prevent a costly two‑front war by securing Austria and reducing incentives for opportunistic attacks into the Balkans.
- Maintain defensive control of Berlin, München and Kiel while avoiding naval‑provoked escalation with England.
- Lock in written, unit‑level non‑aggression assurances with neighbors (England, Austria, Russia, Italy) to present a credible deterrent.
- Preserve flexibility to support Austria if the forecasted aggression materializes, minimizing resource drains and avoiding reckless offensives.
- Advertise verifiable, time‑stamped unit dispositions publicly to raise political costs of opportunism and enable rapid coordination with allies.

TASK
Analyze what actually happened this phase compared to negotiations and expectations.

Consider:
1. BETRAYALS: Who broke their promises? Did you break any promises?
2. COLLABORATIONS: Which agreements were successfully executed?
3. SURPRISES: What unexpected moves occurred?
4. IMPACT: How did these events affect your strategic position?

Write a concise diary entry (100-150 words) of the most important things you would like to remember, e.g.:
- Key betrayals or successful collaborations
- Assess impact on your position
- Update your understanding of other powers' trustworthiness
- Strategic lessons learned
- Moves that failed, and ideas on how to avoid the error in the future

Focus on concrete events and their implications for your future strategy.

I kept A BER, A MUN and F KIE on hold as promised; Austria reciprocated by holding A BOH, A BUD, F TRI and A SER and signaling reliability. England publicly held DEN/HOL/BEL and even supported BEL→HOL, fulfilling our public neutrality framework. Russia, France, Italy and Turkey made no hostile moves. No betrayals occurred — none by Germany or others. Impact: central position remains secure, two‑front risk reduced for now but forecasted 60% coalition aggression still credible; Austria’s steadiness lowers immediate pressure but does not eliminate risk. Trust update: Austria reliable; England cautiously reliable; Russia/Italy untested. Lesson: continue locking unit‑level, time‑stamped assurances and advertise holds publicly; be ready to convert BER/MUN to Balkan support only upon clear Austrian commitment to active Balkan defense.","TRUE"

RECENT DIARY ENTRIES
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] England communicated a clear, maritime-first posture: hold Channel coasts and northern anchors (BEL, HOL, DEN, SWE, NWY) to preserve naval freedom. To France: proposed mutual non‑aggression in the Channel this turn, hold PAR/MAR, avoid risky gambits into PIC/BUR unless timing is shared so England can provide naval-backed support. To Germany: signalled willingness to accept a north‑west non‑aggression understanding (England holds DEN/HOL/BEL; Germany keeps BER/MUN defensive, F KIE non‑provocative) in exchange for German neutrality eastward toward Russia and Austria. To Austria: offered discreet diplomacy and limited naval-shielding options for coastal consolidation; no large British land commitments. To Russia and Turkey: offered limited, time‑bound coordination to deter opportunistic moves that threaten sea lanes, conditional on verifiable actions. England warned all parties that forecasting (storyworld) indicates a ~62% chance that a rival given a low‑risk concession will respond with aggression; this shapes a preference for narrowly bounded, reversible concessions and explicit timing. Germany verbally proposed a north stability deal which England is considering subject to concrete reciprocal terms. No binding alliances were concluded; England prioritizes flexible, conditional understandings and retaining naval leverage.
Intent: I will execute conservative, defensive orders that reflect negotiated postures and maintain leverage. Primary moves I intend and will fulfil: hold A BEL (supported by A HOL), hold A HOL (supporting BEL hold), hold A DEN (supported by A SWE), maintain defensive readiness at A LON, A LVP, A EDI. Keep A NWY, A SWE, A DEN anchored to contest any German approach to KIE (no aggressive Baltic invasions). I will not move into PIC or BUR unless France requests timed support; I will not commit armies into the Balkans or large land reinforcements for Austria. Diplomatically I will: (a) offer Germany a formal, written north non‑aggression assurance conditioned on German commitments to avoid westward pressure on France and to keep BER/MUN defensive; (b) offer France mutual non‑aggression in the Channel and conditional naval support against a German push into PIC/BUR if they notify timing; (c) keep Austria and Turkey limited, reversible maritime assurance options. I intend to honour these promises but will reverse narrowly bounded concessions if signals indicate the ~0.62 aggression outcome materializing.

[S1915M] The fleets and coasts held steady as I intended; my Channel and North Sea anchoring worked. No power pushed into contested coasts—France held PAR/MAR/BRE, Germany kept BER/MUN/KIE passive, Austria consolidated inland. No promises were betrayed this turn; I upheld my restraint by not advancing into PIC/BUR or the Balkans. Collaboration: my coordinated holds (HOL→BEL, SWE→DEN) succeeded and preserved naval freedom. Surprise: unanimity in passivity across the board—no opportunistic grabs despite the forecasted ~62% risk—suggests either mutual caution or collective fatigue. Impact: my maritime dominance and flexibility remain intact; France is reliable for now, Germany appears non‑adversarial but remains a medium trust risk. Lesson: continue narrowly bounded, time‑stamped assurances and insist on verifiable reciprocal language; keep naval readiness and timely signaling to deter the ~0.62 aggression scenario if it manifests.

[F1915M] England secured multilateral, unit-level, reversible assurances designed to lock northern anchors and avoid needless continental escalation. Public framework: England will hold DEN/HOL/BEL/SWE/NWY as defensive anchors; France will hold PAR/BRE/MAR and notify England before any push into PIC/BUR; Austria/Turkey may receive narrowly time‑stamped maritime assurances only if they accept explicit limits. Bilateral with Germany: reciprocal, written north non‑aggression understanding — Germany to keep A BER and A MUN defensive and F KIE strictly non‑provocative (F KIE H); England to refrain from using HOL or DEN to back operations that threaten Kiel or German eastern approaches, conditional on German compliance. All concessions are explicitly reversible and require visible unit postures as verification.
Intent: Execute conservative, defensive orders consistent with promises and naval leverage. Specific intended moves: hold A BEL (supported by A HOL), hold A HOL (supporting BEL hold), hold A DEN (supported by A SWE), maintain defensive holds at A LON, A LVP, A EDI, keep A NWY and A SWE anchored to contest German approach to KIE. I will not move into PIC or BUR this phase unless France provides an explicit, time‑stamped request; I will not commit armies to the Balkans or to Austrian land defense. I intend to fulfil the written assurance to Germany by refraining from HOL/DEN-backed operations threatening KIE and by publicly holding DEN/HOL/BEL. If Germany visibly holds A BER and A MUN and keeps F KIE H, I will treat German moves against Russia/Austria as internal so long as they do not threaten the North Sea/Channel lanes. Any violation of unit commitments will void assurances and prompt immediate naval measures to secure the Channel and Low Countries.

YOUR GOALS
- Preserve British naval freedom of movement and secure Channel/North Sea lanes
- Prevent any continental hegemon by supporting a balance of power with flexible, conditional understandings
- Deter opportunistic exploitation of Austrian weakness while avoiding costly land commitments
- Keep France intact as a western counterweight without encouraging risky French overreach
- Use narrowly bounded, reversible concessions informed by forecasts to avoid baiting aggression
- Require verifiable, unit‑level commitments and time‑stamped notifications for any assistance or restraint

My planned defensive anchors—HOL→BEL, SWE→DEN, NWY tied to SWE—worked as intended and preserved Channel/North Sea freedom. France honoured the mutual restraint by staying in PAR/MAR/BRE; Germany visibly kept BER/MUN/F KIE passive, consistent with the north non‑aggression understanding I was offering. No opportunistic grabs occurred—surprising given the earlier forecast artifact indicating ~62% chance of aggression; that forecast remains a cautionary guide and justifies keeping concessions narrowly reversible. Impact: naval leverage and flexible diplomacy intact; France reliable for now, Germany medium‑trust but behaving.

To Austria: offered discreet diplomacy and limited naval-shielding options for coastal consolidation; no large British land commitments. To Russia and Turkey: offered limited, time‑bound coordination to deter opportunistic moves that threaten sea lanes, conditional on verifiable actions. England warned all parties that forecasting (storyworld) indicates a ~62% chance that a rival given a low‑risk concession will respond with aggression; this shapes a preference for narrowly bounded, reversible concessions and explicit timing.

Keep A NWY, A SWE, A DEN anchored to contest any German approach to KIE (no aggressive Baltic invasions). I will not move into PIC or BUR unless France requests timed support; I will not commit armies into the Balkans or large land reinforcements for Austria.

With Austria I secured an agreement in principle: Germany will not press into TRI/BOH/TYR and will position A MUN and A BER to defend Silesia/Bohemia; Austria will hold VIE/BUD/TRI/SER and avoid moves into MUN/BOH, potentially committing one unit to Balkan defense. With Russia I proposed mutual non-aggression on PRU/SIL (Germany will not advance from BER into PRU/SIL if Russia refrains from moves into PRU/support into WAR→PRU).

Quantitatively: I estimate without coordination a 50–65% chance of incursions into Austrian zones and a 40–55% chance that Germany would be forced into costly two-front reinforcement. With the agreed defensive assurances and posture I project a reduction of that aggression probability by ~20–30 percentage points and lower the cascade risk to ~15–30%.

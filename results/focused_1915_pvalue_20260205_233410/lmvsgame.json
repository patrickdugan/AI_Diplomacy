This buys us mutual breathing room and time to convert local strength into permanent gains.\n\nForecast implication (from the shared artifact): the forecast identifies Austria as having a 60% chance of acting aggressively next phase; therefore I treat a forward Austrian move as a likely scenario and ask you to commit now to restraint to lower that chance and avoid a chain reaction. I judge this forecast with 0.6 confidence and use it to justify pre-emptive diplomacy rather than reactive reprisals.\n\nConcretely: reply with an explicit promise to keep A VIE and A BUD from moving to TYR/ITA/TRI this movement phase and I will order A MAR to support A PAR\u2013BUR (securing our mutual land border) and F BRE to hold or threaten the Channel only if England pushes \u2014 i.e. no surprise amphibious gambits.

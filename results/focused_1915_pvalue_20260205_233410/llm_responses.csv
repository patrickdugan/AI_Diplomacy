SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

No urgent messages requiring direct responses.


﻿NEGOTIATION MESSAGES

TASK
Generate one or more (preferably several) strategic messages to advance your interests.
Always prioritize responding to the messages in the ""RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION"" section.
Maintain consistent conversation threads (unless you are choosing to ignore).

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a single JSON array containing one or more message objects, remembering to properly escape strings:

Required JSON structure:
[
  {
    ""message_type"": ""global"" or ""private"",
    ""content"": ""Your message text""

FORECASTING REQUIREMENT:
- If STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT is present, include one explicit forecast implication sentence and reference the artifact's target power or confidence.
- Prefer quantified language when possible (e.g., probabilities).

I propose we avoid a continental domino by keeping Germany contained in the north and by offering France a safe diplomatic corridor to recover in the west. Practically: England will hold the Channel/North Sea lines firmly and keep our fleets ready to interdict any mass movement across the Channel. This posture preserves flexible coalitions while denying a single continental hegemon the sea lanes it needs to project power. I am open to coordinated moves with anyone willing to stabilize the west and the Low Countries rather than exploit French weakness.""

I can guarantee that, with 80% probability, I will oppose any German thrust into the Channel/North Sea that threatens British naval freedom and your western frontier. The attached forecast artifact (confidence 0.6) indicates a 60% chance you will act aggressively next phase; that increases the risk of miscalculation. Therefore: if you can commit to restraint in the Low Countries for the coming turn (no moves into Belgium/Picardy that would provoke Germany), England will support you diplomatically and keep naval forces positioned to interdict German reinforcement attempts. This lets you consolidate Paris/Brest/Marseilles safely while we jointly pressure any overreach from Berlin. I prefer clear, written confirmation of your intentions this month.""

I will not tolerate a German-enabled rupture of the North Sea that risks permanent British naval disadvantage. If you seek limited gains on the continent, propose them now and we may accept a tacit understanding to avoid interference at sea. Should you instead choose a major thrust through the Low Countries or toward Kie/Den, understand there is a >70% chance England will concentrate naval and diplomatic effort to check that move, and I will seek allies to oppose continental hegemony. Consider flexible deals rather than sharp expansions; your long-term security is better served by a contained Germany in central Europe than by risking a British-led coalition.""

My naval forecast implies that, with Russia and Turkey locked ashore, naval lanes remain safe for now; I will keep it so provided the Danubian front does not spill westward. If you want a discreet non-aggression understanding in the Balkans to secure your core, propose terms and we will consider quiet support to discourage opportunistic interventions.""

In exchange, Austria should: 1) Hold Trieste and Budapest (no offensive moves toward my southern borders without prior message), and 2) Coordinate any offensives through Vienna with my general staff at least one move in advance. This reduces the two-front risk for Germany and lowers the chance of an uncontrolled Balkan cascade that would draw us into a wider war.\\n\\nI will support this with a concrete military posture: A MUN supports A BER or holds to cover against sudden moves; F KIE holds and protects our northern flank. If you accept these terms, reply with 'AGREE — COORDINATE' and indicate any immediate moves so we may place supports accordingly. If you intend to attack (aggression), state your target so we can adjust. My intent: secure reliable Austrian restraint on shared borders with a 90%+ expectation of adherence if you accept.""

This is a pragmatic trade: it stabilizes my two-front calculus and lets you keep your naval freedom.\\n\\nIf agreeable, reply 'AGREE — STATUS-QUO' and I will publicly hold Kie and Berlin and privately limit operations against your holdings in return for you avoiding support to aggressive Austrian or Russian continental moves that threaten my northern supply lines.""

Specifically: you refrain from moves into Prussia without prior warning; Germany will not advance from Munich into Galicia or Bohemia.

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: Fellow powers — England speaks plainly. The map shows France pressed and surrounded; our maritime advantage gives us leverage to shape outcomes without overcommitting land forces. I propose we avoid a continental domino by keeping Germany contained in the north and by offering France a safe diplomatic corridor to recover in the west. Practically: England will hold the Channel/North Sea lines firmly and keep our fleets ready to interdict any mass movement across the Channel. This posture preserves flexible coalitions while denying a single continental hegemon the sea lanes it needs to project power. I am open to coordinated moves with anyone willing to stabilize the west and the Low Countries rather than exploit French weakness.
 FRANCE: France to all: I will be brief. I want peace with my neighbors on the seas and in the south so I can attend to the German problem. There is a forecasted 60% chance Austria will act aggressively next phase; that makes early, transparent commitments valuable. I ask: Austria — promise restraint in the Tyrol/Italy direction; England — promise not to invade Picardy/Brest; Germany — promise not to push into BUR/PIC; Italy — promise not to take TYR/TRI. In return I will visibly posture defensively (PAR→BUR, MAR holds or moves only to PIE if necessary, BRE holds or threatens PIC only as a hedge) and share proposed orders so we avoid accidental escalations. Time is short; an open, signed set of micro-commitments will stabilize the west and let each of us focus on our true priorities.
 GERMANY: To all powers: Germany seeks stability through clear commitments. Forecast artifact forecast_defection_p indicates a 60% chance Austria will behave aggressively next phase; Germany treats that as a material risk to the central front. I urge coordinated, written commitments: Austria hold key Balkan centers unless coordinated; England refrain from continental interference; Russia avoid incursions into Prussia. Germany will posture defensively (A MUN and A BER to cover, F KIE holding) and expects reciprocal, verifiable pledges to prevent rapid escalation. Explicit, mutual assurances now reduce the probability of multi-front conflict and permit focused, predictable diplomacy.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: To Austria — I note your strain in the Balkans. England cannot grant you territorial primacy there, but we are willing to leave you breathing space if you avoid stirring a Russian-Turkish conflagration that would draw in others. My naval forecast implies that, with Russia and Turkey locked ashore, naval lanes remain safe for now; I will keep it so provided the Danubian front does not spill westward. If you want a discreet non-aggression understanding in the Balkans to secure your core, propose terms and we will consider quiet support to discourage opportunistic interventions.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: My friend in Vienna — France to Austria, frank and quick. The map says you are strained in the Balkans and I see opportunity for both of us if we act with care. England commands the sea and Germany is a steady threat to my north; you cannot afford needless fights in your rear. I propose a simple bargain: I will not contest Trieste or press into the Adriatic if you keep your armies focused eastward (BUD/VIE fronts) and refrain from moving on Italy or Tyrol this season. In return I will move to secure my northern flank and pressure Germany where feasible, easing the strategic squeeze on you. This buys us mutual breathing room and time to convert local strength into permanent gains.

Forecast implication (from the shared artifact): the forecast identifies Austria as having a 60% chance of acting aggressively next phase; therefore I treat a forward Austrian move as a likely scenario and ask you to commit now to restraint to lower that chance and avoid a chain reaction. I judge this forecast with 0.6 confidence and use it to justify pre-emptive diplomacy rather than reactive reprisals.

Concretely: reply with an explicit promise to keep A VIE and A BUD from moving to TYR/ITA/TRI this movement phase and I will order A MAR to support A PAR–BUR (securing our mutual land border) and F BRE to hold or threaten the Channel only if England pushes — i.e. no surprise amphibious gambits. That gives both of us an 80%+ chance to consolidate home centers rather than bleed forces. Say yes and we will exchange line-by-line orders to make this lock credible.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Austria — this is Berlin. The situation is grave but manageable if we coordinate precisely. I judge there is a 60% chance you will act aggressively next phase (STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT forecast_defection_p; confidence 0.6); that implies you may seize initiative in the Balkans without warning. Given that risk, Germany is prepared to offer calibrated support but requires firm commitments in return.

Proposal: We keep Munich and Berlin secure and guarantee no unplanned thrust into Austrian-held Serbia from my side this year. In exchange, Austria should: 1) Hold Trieste and Budapest (no offensive moves toward my southern borders without prior message), and 2) Coordinate any offensives through Vienna with my general staff at least one move in advance. This reduces the two-front risk for Germany and lowers the chance of an uncontrolled Balkan cascade that would draw us into a wider war.

I will support this with a concrete military posture: A MUN supports A BER or holds to cover against sudden moves; F KIE holds and protects our northern flank. If you accept these terms, reply with 'AGREE — COORDINATE' and indicate any immediate moves so we may place supports accordingly. If you intend to attack (aggression), state your target so we can adjust. My intent: secure reliable Austrian restraint on shared borders with a 90%+ expectation of adherence if you accept.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: To Italy — England values Italy as a potential partner in preserving Mediterranean trade lanes. We will avoid projecting power into your Adriatic sphere provided you do not ally permanently with powers seeking wide continental dominance. If you want British naval patrols to keep sea routes open and reassure neutrals, ask; we can calibrate our presence so long as Italy maintains flexible diplomacy and does not become a land base for a hegemonic partner.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: Rome — France proposes clarity and profit. You hold four units and Italy is the swing in the south.

**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: Fellow powers — England speaks plainly. The map shows France pressed and surrounded; our maritime advantage gives us leverage to shape outcomes without overcommitting land forces. I propose we avoid a continental domino by keeping Germany contained in the north and by offering France a safe diplomatic corridor to recover in the west. Practically: England will hold the Channel/North Sea lines firmly and keep our fleets ready to interdict any mass movement across the Channel. This posture preserves flexible coalitions while denying a single continental hegemon the sea lanes it needs to project power. I am open to coordinated moves with anyone willing to stabilize the west and the Low Countries rather than exploit French weakness.
 FRANCE: France to all: I will be brief. I want peace with my neighbors on the seas and in the south so I can attend to the German problem. There is a forecasted 60% chance Austria will act aggressively next phase; that makes early, transparent commitments valuable. I ask: Austria — promise restraint in the Tyrol/Italy direction; England — promise not to invade Picardy/Brest; Germany — promise not to push into BUR/PIC; Italy — promise not to take TYR/TRI. In return I will visibly posture defensively (PAR→BUR, MAR holds or moves only to PIE if necessary, BRE holds or threatens PIC only as a hedge) and share proposed orders so we avoid accidental escalations. Time is short; an open, signed set of micro-commitments will stabilize the west and let each of us focus on our true priorities.
 GERMANY: To all powers: Germany seeks stability through clear commitments. Forecast artifact forecast_defection_p indicates a 60% chance Austria will behave aggressively next phase; Germany treats that as a material risk to the central front. I urge coordinated, written commitments: Austria hold key Balkan centers unless coordinated; England refrain from continental interference; Russia avoid incursions into Prussia. Germany will posture defensively (A MUN and A BER to cover, F KIE holding) and expects reciprocal, verifiable pledges to prevent rapid escalation. Explicit, mutual assurances now reduce the probability of multi-front conflict and permit focused, predictable diplomacy.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: To Russia — Your focus in the Black Sea ties up your fleets and keeps you distant from the northern maritime balance. England will continue to respect your northern approaches so long as you do not attempt naval forays into the North Sea that could reopen the Channel. If you are prepared to maintain pressure against Turkey and avoid northern naval provocations, England will withhold moves against your Scandinavian lines and can offer intelligence about German fleet dispositions. We prefer a stable eastern front that leaves room to check Germany in the north.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: Moscow — Germany speaks plainly. The Balkans and Black Sea fights are escalating; intelligence flags a 60% chance Austria will act aggressively next phase (forecast_defection_p). If Austria opens offensively, Germany faces a higher probability of having to commit more forces eastward, which in turn lowers our capacity to check British naval advantages in the north.

I propose a tacit de-escalation: you and I agree to avoid border provocations across Prussia and Galicia for the next season. Specifically: you refrain from moves into Prussia without prior warning; Germany will not advance from Munich into Galicia or Bohemia. This lowers the odds of miscalculation (I estimate reducing the two-front escalation risk by ~50%). If you accept, reply 'AGREE — EASTERN STABILITY' and disclose your next-phase intentions toward Prussia or Galicia so we can lock support allocations.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: To Germany — A candid note from the Admiralty’s steward of balance: England values stable northern seas. I will not tolerate a German-enabled rupture of the North Sea that risks permanent British naval disadvantage. If you seek limited gains on the continent, propose them now and we may accept a tacit understanding to avoid interference at sea. Should you instead choose a major thrust through the Low Countries or toward Kie/Den, understand there is a >70% chance England will concentrate naval and diplomatic effort to check that move, and I will seek allies to oppose continental hegemony. Consider flexible deals rather than sharp expansions; your long-term security is better served by a contained Germany in central Europe than by risking a British-led coalition.
  GERMANY: London — Germany here. England's maritime dominance is obvious and presents a persistent strategic risk to continental balance. I forecast (based on current dispositions and intelligence) that if Austria acts aggressively in the Balkans (60% probability per forecast_defection_p, target: Austria), this could force Germany into reactive land commitments that would increase pressure on your naval lines by up to 30–40% via refugee flows and secondary operations. That is an unacceptable destabilizer.

Proposal: A non-aggression understanding for the next two phases: you refrain from continental encroachment beyond the Low Countries; Germany will not contest British naval movements in the North Sea provided you do not support raids aimed at my northern coasts or incite neutral powers against my home centers. This is a pragmatic trade: it stabilizes my two-front calculus and lets you keep your naval freedom.

If agreeable, reply 'AGREE — STATUS-QUO' and I will publicly hold Kie and Berlin and privately limit operations against your holdings in return for you avoiding support to aggressive Austrian or Russian continental moves that threaten my northern supply lines.

 Conversation with FRANCE:
  FRANCE: Berlin — France here. No illusions: your central position makes you the principal variable in my security calculations. I seek a stable western front so I can deal with Italy and the Mediterranean risks. I will be blunt: if you press west aggressively, I will respond by seeking English cooperation and by shifting forces from Marseilles to Picardy/Burgundy. If instead you keep MUN/BER as defensive anchors and avoid inciting England, I will not contest your holdings in the Rhineland and will refrain from supporting English naval adventures against you.

Forecast implication (artifact): the forecast flags Austria as the likely aggressive actor (60% probability). That raises the risk of Austrian actions pulling you east or provoking allied shifts; therefore I prefer an understanding that avoids simultaneous German and Austrian offensives. Practically, if you pledge to avoid moves into BUR/MUN that threaten PAR/BEL this phase, I will order PAR→BUR and BRE→PIC (supportable) as a visible hedge but not an escalation. A short, explicit pledge from you not to open toward PAR or BUR this move will settle matters quickly.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  GERMANY: Austria — this is Berlin. The situation is grave but manageable if we coordinate precisely. I judge there is a 60% chance you will act aggressively next phase (STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT forecast_defection_p; confidence 0.6); that implies you may seize initiative in the Balkans without warning. Given that risk, Germany is prepared to offer calibrated support but requires firm commitments in return.

Proposal: We keep Munich and Berlin secure and guarantee no unplanned thrust into Austrian-held Serbia from my side this year. In exchange, Austria should: 1) Hold Trieste and Budapest (no offensive moves toward my southern borders without prior message), and 2) Coordinate any offensives through Vienna with my general staff at least one move in advance. This reduces the two-front risk for Germany and lowers the chance of an uncontrolled Balkan cascade that would draw us into a wider war.

I will support this with a concrete military posture: A MUN supports A BER or holds to cover against sudden moves; F KIE holds and protects our northern flank. If you accept these terms, reply with 'AGREE — COORDINATE' and indicate any immediate moves so we may place supports accordingly. If you intend to attack (aggression), state your target so we can adjust. My intent: secure reliable Austrian restraint on shared borders with a 90%+ expectation of adherence if you accept.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  GERMANY: Moscow — Germany speaks plainly. The Balkans and Black Sea fights are escalating; intelligence flags a 60% chance Austria will act aggressively next phase (forecast_defection_p). If Austria opens offensively, Germany faces a higher probability of having to commit more forces eastward, which in turn lowers our capacity to check British naval advantages in the north.

I propose a tacit de-escalation: you and I agree to avoid border provocations across Prussia and Galicia for the next season. Specifically: you refrain from moves into Prussia without prior warning; Germany will not advance from Munich into Galicia or Bohemia. This lowers the odds of miscalculation (I estimate reducing the two-front escalation risk by ~50%). If you accept, reply 'AGREE — EASTERN STABILITY' and disclose your next-phase intentions toward Prussia or Galicia so we can lock support allocations.

Therefore I prioritized: 1) extracting an explicit Austrian commitment to hold TRI and BUD and to coordinate offensives (to reduce eastern shock probability), 2) offering defensive, verifiable postures to France and Russia to lower miscalculation odds, and 3) securing England's tacit non‑interference at sea so diplomatic space remains to respond if Austria defects.

 GERMANY: To all powers: Germany seeks stability through clear commitments.

Explicit, mutual assurances now reduce the probability of multi-front conflict and permit focused, predictable diplomacy.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with FRANCE:
  ENGLAND: To France — Your position is perilous but not yet hopeless. England will not stand idle if a collapse on your flank produces a German maritime advantage. I can guarantee that, with 80% probability, I will oppose any German thrust into the Channel/North Sea that threatens British naval freedom and your western frontier. The attached forecast artifact (confidence 0.6) indicates a 60% chance you will act aggressively next phase; that increases the risk of miscalculation. Therefore: if you can commit to restraint in the Low Countries for the coming turn (no moves into Belgium/Picardy that would provoke Germany), England will support you diplomatically and keep naval forces positioned to interdict German reinforcement attempts. This lets you consolidate Paris/Brest/Marseilles safely while we jointly pressure any overreach from Berlin. I prefer clear, written confirmation of your intentions this month.
  FRANCE: To our naval neighbor — France speaking plainly: England dominates the sea and I am not inclined to fight you for Channel masters unless pressed. My primary strategic need is security against Germany, not conflict with you. I propose mutual moderation: you keep your forces from aggressive pushes into Picardy/Belgium this phase, and I will refrain from sending F BRE into ENG or MAO. In exchange, I will use A MAR and A PAR to contest any German incursions toward the Rhine and support actions that blunt German access to the Channel. This preserves your naval freedom and gives me the breathing space to address Germany without overcommitting at sea.

Forecast implication (artifact): the shared forecast implies Austria has a 60% probability of aggression next phase — a separate but correlated risk to the system. If Austria acts up, England's naval dominance will be crucial for rapid redeployments; your restraint now increases overall stability and reduces the chance of cascading conflict. I estimate these cooperative moves increase our joint probability of holding current centers from ~50% to ~75% this year. Reply with a clear non-aggression promise toward Picardy/Brest for S1915M and I will lock my Channel posture publicly so neither of us surprises the other.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  ENGLAND: To Germany — A candid note from the Admiralty’s steward of balance: England values stable northern seas. I will not tolerate a German-enabled rupture of the North Sea that risks permanent British naval disadvantage. If you seek limited gains on the continent, propose them now and we may accept a tacit understanding to avoid interference at sea. Should you instead choose a major thrust through the Low Countries or toward Kie/Den, understand there is a >70% chance England will concentrate naval and diplomatic effort to check that move, and I will seek allies to oppose continental hegemony. Consider flexible deals rather than sharp expansions; your long-term security is better served by a contained Germany in central Europe than by risking a British-led coalition.
  GERMANY: London — Germany here. England's maritime dominance is obvious and presents a persistent strategic risk to continental balance. I forecast (based on current dispositions and intelligence) that if Austria acts aggressively in the Balkans (60% probability per forecast_defection_p, target: Austria), this could force Germany into reactive land commitments that would increase pressure on your naval lines by up to 30–40% via refugee flows and secondary operations. That is an unacceptable destabilizer.

Proposal: A non-aggression understanding for the next two phases: you refrain from continental encroachment beyond the Low Countries; Germany will not contest British naval movements in the North Sea provided you do not support raids aimed at my northern coasts or incite neutral powers against my home centers. This is a pragmatic trade: it stabilizes my two-front calculus and lets you keep your naval freedom.

If agreeable, reply 'AGREE — STATUS-QUO' and I will publicly hold Kie and Berlin and privately limit operations against your holdings in return for you avoiding support to aggressive Austrian or Russian continental moves that threaten my northern supply lines.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  ENGLAND: To Austria — I note your strain in the Balkans. England cannot grant you territorial primacy there, but we are willing to leave you breathing space if you avoid stirring a Russian-Turkish conflagration that would draw in others. My naval forecast implies that, with Russia and Turkey locked ashore, naval lanes remain safe for now; I will keep it so provided the Danubian front does not spill westward. If you want a discreet non-aggression understanding in the Balkans to secure your core, propose terms and we will consider quiet support to discourage opportunistic interventions.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  ENGLAND: To Russia — Your focus in the Black Sea ties up your fleets and keeps you distant from the northern maritime balance. England will continue to respect your northern approaches so long as you do not attempt naval forays into the North Sea that could reopen the Channel. If you are prepared to maintain pressure against Turkey and avoid northern naval provocations, England will withhold moves against your Scandinavian lines and can offer intelligence about German fleet dispositions. We prefer a stable eastern front that leaves room to check Germany in the north.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  ENGLAND: To Italy — England values Italy as a potential partner in preserving Mediterranean trade lanes. We will avoid projecting power into your Adriatic sphere provided you do not ally permanently with powers seeking wide continental dominance. If you want British naval patrols to keep sea routes open and reassure neutrals, ask; we can calibrate our presence so long as Italy maintains flexible diplomacy and does not become a land base for a hegemonic partner.

This increased my estimated probability of regional destabilization if commitments are not secured—shifting my joint-hold probability estimates (with France) upward from ~50% to ~75% if France provides restraint, per prior bilateral math. Therefore I (1) demanded a clear Low Countries non-aggression pledge from France, (2) committed to keeping Channel/North Sea forces ready to interdict (increasing deterrent probability vs. German breakout to >70%), and (3) prioritized diplomatic bandwidth to monitor Austria in the Balkans because forecasted aggression there correlates with higher risk to northern lines. The forecast directly influenced the decision to bind naval posture publicly and to refuse continental encroachment that would undermine those deterrent effects.""

Messages This Round:
**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 ENGLAND: Fellow powers — England speaks plainly. The map shows France pressed and surrounded; our maritime advantage gives us leverage to shape outcomes without overcommitting land forces. I propose we avoid a continental domino by keeping Germany contained in the north and by offering France a safe diplomatic corridor to recover in the west. Practically: England will hold the Channel/North Sea lines firmly and keep our fleets ready to interdict any mass movement across the Channel. This posture preserves flexible coalitions while denying a single continental hegemon the sea lanes it needs to project power. I am open to coordinated moves with anyone willing to stabilize the west and the Low Countries rather than exploit French weakness.
 FRANCE: France to all: I will be brief. I want peace with my neighbors on the seas and in the south so I can attend to the German problem. There is a forecasted 60% chance Austria will act aggressively next phase; that makes early, transparent commitments valuable. I ask: Austria — promise restraint in the Tyrol/Italy direction; England — promise not to invade Picardy/Brest; Germany — promise not to push into BUR/PIC; Italy — promise not to take TYR/TRI. In return I will visibly posture defensively (PAR→BUR, MAR holds or moves only to PIE if necessary, BRE holds or threatens PIC only as a hedge) and share proposed orders so we avoid accidental escalations. Time is short; an open, signed set of micro-commitments will stabilize the west and let each of us focus on our true priorities.
 GERMANY: To all powers: Germany seeks stability through clear commitments. Forecast artifact forecast_defection_p indicates a 60% chance Austria will behave aggressively next phase; Germany treats that as a material risk to the central front. I urge coordinated, written commitments: Austria hold key Balkan centers unless coordinated; England refrain from continental interference; Russia avoid incursions into Prussia. Germany will posture defensively (A MUN and A BER to cover, F KIE holding) and expects reciprocal, verifiable pledges to prevent rapid escalation. Explicit, mutual assurances now reduce the probability of multi-front conflict and permit focused, predictable diplomacy.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  ENGLAND: To France — Your position is perilous but not yet hopeless. England will not stand idle if a collapse on your flank produces a German maritime advantage. I can guarantee that, with 80% probability, I will oppose any German thrust into the Channel/North Sea that threatens British naval freedom and your western frontier. The attached forecast artifact (confidence 0.6) indicates a 60% chance you will act aggressively next phase; that increases the risk of miscalculation. Therefore: if you can commit to restraint in the Low Countries for the coming turn (no moves into Belgium/Picardy that would provoke Germany), England will support you diplomatically and keep naval forces positioned to interdict German reinforcement attempts. This lets you consolidate Paris/Brest/Marseilles safely while we jointly pressure any overreach from Berlin. I prefer clear, written confirmation of your intentions this month.
  FRANCE: To our naval neighbor — France speaking plainly: England dominates the sea and I am not inclined to fight you for Channel masters unless pressed. My primary strategic need is security against Germany, not conflict with you. I propose mutual moderation: you keep your forces from aggressive pushes into Picardy/Belgium this phase, and I will refrain from sending F BRE into ENG or MAO. In exchange, I will use A MAR and A PAR to contest any German incursions toward the Rhine and support actions that blunt German access to the Channel. This preserves your naval freedom and gives me the breathing space to address Germany without overcommitting at sea.

Forecast implication (artifact): the shared forecast implies Austria has a 60% probability of aggression next phase — a separate but correlated risk to the system. If Austria acts up, England's naval dominance will be crucial for rapid redeployments; your restraint now increases overall stability and reduces the chance of cascading conflict. I estimate these cooperative moves increase our joint probability of holding current centers from ~50% to ~75% this year. Reply with a clear non-aggression promise toward Picardy/Brest for S1915M and I will lock my Channel posture publicly so neither of us surprises the other.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  FRANCE: My friend in Vienna — France to Austria, frank and quick. The map says you are strained in the Balkans and I see opportunity for both of us if we act with care. England commands the sea and Germany is a steady threat to my north; you cannot afford needless fights in your rear. I propose a simple bargain: I will not contest Trieste or press into the Adriatic if you keep your armies focused eastward (BUD/VIE fronts) and refrain from moving on Italy or Tyrol this season. In return I will move to secure my northern flank and pressure Germany where feasible, easing the strategic squeeze on you. This buys us mutual breathing room and time to convert local strength into permanent gains.

Forecast implication (from the shared artifact): the forecast identifies Austria as having a 60% chance of acting aggressively next phase; therefore I treat a forward Austrian move as a likely scenario and ask you to commit now to restraint to lower that chance and avoid a chain reaction. I judge this forecast with 0.6 confidence and use it to justify pre-emptive diplomacy rather than reactive reprisals.

Concretely: reply with an explicit promise to keep A VIE and A BUD from moving to TYR/ITA/TRI this movement phase and I will order A MAR to support A PAR–BUR (securing our mutual land border) and F BRE to hold or threaten the Channel only if England pushes — i.e. no surprise amphibious gambits. That gives both of us an 80%+ chance to consolidate home centers rather than bleed forces. Say yes and we will exchange line-by-line orders to make this lock credible.

 Conversation with GERMANY:
  FRANCE: Berlin — France here. No illusions: your central position makes you the principal variable in my security calculations. I seek a stable western front so I can deal with Italy and the Mediterranean risks. I will be blunt: if you press west aggressively, I will respond by seeking English cooperation and by shifting forces from Marseilles to Picardy/Burgundy. If instead you keep MUN/BER as defensive anchors and avoid inciting England, I will not contest your holdings in the Rhineland and will refrain from supporting English naval adventures against you.

Forecast implication (artifact): the forecast flags Austria as the likely aggressive actor (60% probability). That raises the risk of Austrian actions pulling you east or provoking allied shifts; therefore I prefer an understanding that avoids simultaneous German and Austrian offensives. Practically, if you pledge to avoid moves into BUR/MUN that threaten PAR/BEL this phase, I will order PAR→BUR and BRE→PIC (supportable) as a visible hedge but not an escalation. A short, explicit pledge from you not to open toward PAR or BUR this move will settle matters quickly.

 Conversation with ITALY:
  FRANCE: Rome — France proposes clarity and profit. You hold four units and Italy is the swing in the south. I propose non-aggression across our mutual frontier: you refrain from taking Tyrol or pressing on Trieste this phase and I will leave Marseilles and Paris focused north rather than sending forces into Piedmont. In return I will not contest your Tunis or press aggressively into the Tyrol by sea. This frees both of us to pursue gains elsewhere.

Note on forecasting: the shared forecast shows Austria is 60% likely to act aggressively; if Austria moves toward you or the Balkans flare, I would rather not be fighting you at the same time. A clear Italian pledge reduces the chance of a two-front southern war and increases our mutual survival odds by an estimated 20–30% this year. Reply with a simple yes/no to commit to non-aggression toward Tyrol/Trient for this phase.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[S1915M] France secured conditional non‑aggression understandings with England, Austria, Germany, and Italy. England promises to refrain from aggressive continental moves into Picardy/Belgium in exchange for a French public pledge to avoid naval aggression toward England (no BRE→ENG/MAO). Austria agreed (requested) to keep A VIE and A BUD from moving into TYR/ITA/TRI in return for French restraint and a commitment to support toward BUR; Italy was asked to pledge non‑aggression toward TYR/TRI in exchange for French restraint in Piedmont/Tunisia; Germany was asked to avoid opening on BUR/PIC toward Paris in return for French hedging moves. All agreements are explicit, tactical, and conditional on visible orders/exchanges to reduce accident and escalation.
Intent: For S1915M I intend to honor the bargains to stabilize my western and southern borders while preparing a defensive posture vs Germany. Planned orders I will issue: A PAR→BUR (supportable commitment to pressure/defend Burgundy), F BRE hold (threaten PIC only as a hedge; no move toward England), A MAR hold (or move to PIE only if Italy violates pledge). I will not move into BEL/PIC or send F BRE into ENG/MAO. If Austria or Italy break their pledges (movement toward TYR/TRI), I will pivot A MAR→PIE and contest the Alpine approaches; if Germany opens aggressively on BUR/PIC toward PAR I will convert the PAR→BUR hedge into an actual attack/support and request English naval support. I intend to fulfill my commitments unless a clear, immediate betrayal forces a defensive deviation.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Output Moves in JSON (first)
  - return an order for each of your units.
2. Reason (brief)
  - 1-2 sentences max.

Respond with this exact format:

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

}}

Reasoning:
(1-2 short sentences)","PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{
  ""orders"": [""A PAR - BUR"", ""F BRE H"", ""A MAR H""]
}

Reasoning:
A PAR→BUR signals a defend/contest of Burgundy to deter a German push toward Paris while keeping support flexibility; F BRE holds (per pledge) to avoid escalation with England yet threatens PIC as a future hedge; A MAR holds to preserve Marseilles and respect Italy/Austria non‑aggression while allowing a quick pivot to PIE/BUR if allies betray.","Success"

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[S1915M] Germany secured tentative, explicit non‑aggression understandings with England, France, Austria, and Russia focused on reducing two‑front and naval escalation risks. England agreed to refrain from continental interference beyond the Low Countries in exchange for Germany not contesting British North Sea movements and holding Kie/Berlin ('AGREE — STATUS-QUO' proposal pending their reply). France asked for a German pledge not to push into BUR/PIC; Germany committed to defensive postures in MUN/BER and to avoid thrusts toward PAR/BUR this phase. Austria was given a calibrated offer: German support conditioned on Austrian public holds of TRI and BUD and coordination of any Balkan offensives ('AGREE — COORDINATE' requested). Russia was offered a tacit de-escalation: reciprocal avoidance of Prussian/Galician provocations for this season ('AGREE — EASTERN STABILITY' requested). All agreements are contingent on reciprocal, verifiable moves; Germany signaled concrete defensive orders (A MUN supporting A BER/hold; F KIE hold) to demonstrate seriousness.
Intent: For S1915M Germany will adopt a defensive, verifiable posture to lock in commitments: A BER — hold; A MUN — support A BER (or hold to protect Berlin/Munich line); F KIE — hold. I intend to publicly refrain from moves into BUR/PIC/PAR and from offensives toward Galicia/Bohemia this phase to honor pacts with France and Russia, and I will not support or provoke actions against English naval freedom in the North Sea. If Austria explicitly declares aggression (target disclosed), I will re-evaluate supports but will first request coordination as promised. I intend to fulfill these pledges to reduce multi-front risk and to increase diplomatic credibility; if any partner violates their assurance, I will reserve the right to retaliate in following phases.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[S1915M] England has publicly committed to holding the Channel/North Sea lines and using naval leverage to prevent any German maritime breakout. France and England have a bilateral understanding: France will refrain from aggressive moves into Belgium/Picardy and will not send F BRE toward England; in return England will not push into Picardy/Brest and will posture naval forces to interdict German reinforcement attempts. Germany has proposed a limited non-aggression understanding focused on the north; England warned Germany that a major Low Countries thrust will provoke naval and diplomatic opposition. England signaled to Austria and Russia that we will tolerate limited Balkan breathing space so long as aggression there does not spill westward or threaten sea lanes. England offered conditional naval reassurance to Italy and Russia in exchange for flexible diplomacy and no northern naval provocations. Forecast artifact (forecast_coalition_p / 'forecast_defection_p') indicates a 60% probability France will act aggressively next phase (mapped as a risk of central/front instability); this was explicitly cited in negotiations and used to press France for a written Low Countries non-aggression pledge and to justify England’s firm Channel posture.
Intent: For S1915M England intends to maintain a defensive naval posture: hold fleets that control Channel/North Sea approaches to interdict any German move threatening British naval freedom (no aggressive fleet sorties into French waters). On land, England will not move into Picardy/Brest (we will honour the promise to France). Specific implied orders to be executed: fleets hold/defend Channel and North Sea approaches (publicly signalled), no army moves into BEL/PIC, maintain A LON/A LVP/A EDI/A NWY/A DEN/A SWE/A HOL/A BEL/A SPA/A POR positions except for repositioning that preserves maritime control and does not violate promises. England intends to fulfill agreed promises to France and Germany while remaining ready to concentrate diplomatically and with allies if Germany or Austria escalate. If Austria acts aggressively in the Balkans (per forecast), England will accelerate diplomatic outreach and consider diverting support to coastal interdiction or to allies threatened by cascade effects.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Output Moves in JSON (first)
  - return an order for each of your units.
2. Reason (brief)
  - 1-2 sentences max.

Respond with this exact format:

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
}}

Reasoning:
(1-2 short sentences)","PARSABLE OUTPUT:

    ""A SPA H"",
    ""A SWE S A NWY""
  ]
}

Reasoning:
Hold the Channel/North Sea line and posture to contest German moves while improving coastal coverage (EDIN → CLY to flex for support), honoring the Franco non-aggression understanding and using supports to reinforce Belgian and northern stability per the forecasted French aggression risk.","Success"

YOUR GOALS
- Preserve British naval freedom in the Channel and North Sea; deny any power a maritime advantage.
- Prevent a single continental hegemon by containing German expansion in the north and keeping coalitions flexible.
- Stabilize the western front by securing a Franco-English non-aggression understanding for Picardy/Brest/Belgium this phase.
- Monitor Austrian behavior in the Balkans and be prepared to diplomatically and materially check any aggressive cascade that threatens sea lanes.
- Avoid unnecessary continental land commitments while using naval leverage to shape outcomes.

TASK
Analyze what actually happened this phase compared to negotiations and expectations.

Consider:
1. BETRAYALS: Who broke their promises? Did you break any promises?
2. COLLABORATIONS: Which agreements were successfully executed?
3. SURPRISES: What unexpected moves occurred?
4. IMPACT: How did these events affect your strategic position?

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a diary entry text. Do not include JSON or formatting markers.","France honored our Low Countries understanding: no move into Belgium/Picardy and Brest fleet held. Germany remained static in the north; Austria’s orders were benign. I kept to our commitments—fleets holding Channel/North Sea, no army moves into BEL/PIC—and reinforced naval posture by redeploying LON→YOR and EDI→CLY to preserve lines. Forecast artifact (60% risk France aggression) was cited in talks and proved prudent; France’s restraint this phase reduces immediate northern instability but does not eliminate the modeled 60% temptation next round. No betrayals observed; collaborations with France succeeded. Surprise: overall tranquility—everyone held—so our decision to avoid continental land commitments was vindicated. Lesson: maintain firm, visible naval posture and press France for a written, time-bound Low Countries pledge to counter the persistent forecasted risk.","TRUE"

--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] France secured conditional non‑aggression understandings with England, Austria, Germany, and Italy. England promises to refrain from aggressive continental moves into Picardy/Belgium in exchange for a French public pledge to avoid naval aggression toward England (no BRE→ENG/MAO). Austria agreed (requested) to keep A VIE and A BUD from moving into TYR/ITA/TRI in return for French restraint and a commitment to support toward BUR; Italy was asked to pledge non‑aggression toward TYR/TRI in exchange for French restraint in Piedmont/Tunisia; Germany was asked to avoid opening on BUR/PIC toward Paris in return for French hedging moves. All agreements are explicit, tactical, and conditional on visible orders/exchanges to reduce accident and escalation.
Intent: For S1915M I intend to honor the bargains to stabilize my western and southern borders while preparing a defensive posture vs Germany. Planned orders I will issue: A PAR→BUR (supportable commitment to pressure/defend Burgundy), F BRE hold (threaten PIC only as a hedge; no move toward England), A MAR hold (or move to PIE only if Italy violates pledge). I will not move into BEL/PIC or send F BRE into ENG/MAO. If Austria or Italy break their pledges (movement toward TYR/TRI), I will pivot A MAR→PIE and contest the Alpine approaches; if Germany opens aggressively on BUR/PIC toward PAR I will convert the PAR→BUR hedge into an actual attack/support and request English naval support. I intend to fulfill my commitments unless a clear, immediate betrayal forces a defensive deviation.

RUSSIA: Neutral
ITALY: Neutral

YOUR GOALS
- Primary: Prevent a German pivot that threatens Paris/Burgundy and secure breathing room to address Mediterranean/Italian risks.
- Secondary: Preserve French home centers (PAR, BRE, MAR) this phase via defensive posturing and clear non‑aggression pacts with England and Italy.
- Tertiary: Use diplomatic leverage to induce Austrian restraint in the Tyrol/Balkans to avoid multi‑front escalation.

TASK
Analyze what actually happened this phase compared to negotiations and expectations.

Consider:
1. BETRAYALS: Who broke their promises? Did you break any promises?
2. COLLABORATIONS: Which agreements were successfully executed?
3. SURPRISES: What unexpected moves occurred?
4. IMPACT: How did these events affect your strategic position?

Write a concise diary entry (100-150 words) of the most important things you would like to remember, e.g.:
- Key betrayals or successful collaborations
- Assess impact on your position
- Update your understanding of other powers' trustworthiness
- Strategic lessons learned
- Moves that failed, and ideas on how to avoid the error in the future

Focus on concrete events and their implications for your future strategy.

England kept its pledge — no naval probe into Picardy/Belgium and BEL remained passive — reinforcing Anglo‑French trust for now. Austria’s orders were idle; no Tyrol/Italy incursion occurred, so Vienna kept its word by omission. Germany showed no aggressive opening toward BUR/PIC; Berlin and Munich both held, so my defensive posture stands intact.

No outright betrayals this phase. Collaborations succeeded: the tacit Anglophone restraint and Austria’s inaction preserved my western and southern flanks. Surprise: overall paralysis — everyone held — reducing immediate risk but also leaving uncertainty about intentions. Impact: I remain secure for one turn but cannot afford complacency; German inactivity may conceal a future opening. Lesson: visible, exchange‑backed hedges work — continue conditional public commitments and keep PAR→BUR as a rapid convert-to-attack option; monitor Austria and Italy closely for sudden Alpine moves and lean on England’s naval leverage if Berlin shifts toward Burgundy.","TRUE"

[S1915M] Germany secured tentative, explicit non‑aggression understandings with England, France, Austria, and Russia focused on reducing two‑front and naval escalation risks. England agreed to refrain from continental interference beyond the Low Countries in exchange for Germany not contesting British North Sea movements and holding Kie/Berlin ('AGREE — STATUS-QUO' proposal pending their reply). France asked for a German pledge not to push into BUR/PIC; Germany committed to defensive postures in MUN/BER and to avoid thrusts toward PAR/BUR this phase. Austria was given a calibrated offer: German support conditioned on Austrian public holds of TRI and BUD and coordination of any Balkan offensives ('AGREE — COORDINATE' requested). Russia was offered a tacit de-escalation: reciprocal avoidance of Prussian/Galician provocations for this season ('AGREE — EASTERN STABILITY' requested). All agreements are contingent on reciprocal, verifiable moves; Germany signaled concrete defensive orders (A MUN supporting A BER/hold; F KIE hold) to demonstrate seriousness.
Intent: For S1915M Germany will adopt a defensive, verifiable posture to lock in commitments: A BER — hold; A MUN — support A BER (or hold to protect Berlin/Munich line); F KIE — hold. I intend to publicly refrain from moves into BUR/PIC/PAR and from offensives toward Galicia/Bohemia this phase to honor pacts with France and Russia, and I will not support or provoke actions against English naval freedom in the North Sea. If Austria explicitly declares aggression (target disclosed), I will re-evaluate supports but will first request coordination as promised. I intend to fulfill these pledges to reduce multi-front risk and to increase diplomatic credibility; if any partner violates their assurance, I will reserve the right to retaliate in following phases.

YOUR GOALS
- Avoid a simultaneous two‑front war by securing non‑aggression assurances from England, France, Russia, and Austria this season
- Lock Germany's northern and central positions (hold BER, MUN, KIE) to demonstrate credibility and reduce miscalculation
- Force Austria to coordinate Balkan offensives and hold TRI/BUD to prevent an unexpected eastern cascade
- Preserve Britain’s freedom at sea to avoid a British‑led coalition while minimizing continental concessions
- Monitor Austrian behavior this phase and be prepared to shift support east if forecasted aggression materializes

Do not include JSON or formatting markers.","S1915M — Diary: Germany held to our pledge (A BER H, F KIE H, A MUN S A BER) and thus demonstrated credibility; no promise by us was broken. England upheld restraint at sea and on the continent — BEL held, naval moves limited to Britain — reinforcing their cooperative posture. France, however, violated our understanding: PAR → BUR is an offensive move contrary to our explicit pledge to avoid pressure on BUR/PIC; this raises concern about French reliability. Austria largely complied publicly (TRI, BUD held) though VIE’s attempted support to MUN→BOH (void) signals latent aggressive intent if unchecked. No Russian provocation occurred. Net effect: two‑front risk remains reduced for now, but France’s move and Austria’s hidden willingness to support eastern action require renewed diplomatic verification and conditional contingency planning; prioritize tightened verification with France and clearer coordination demands of Austria next phase.","TRUE"

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

No urgent messages requiring direct responses.


﻿NEGOTIATION MESSAGES

TASK
Generate one or more (preferably several) strategic messages to advance your interests.
Always prioritize responding to the messages in the ""RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION"" section.
Maintain consistent conversation threads (unless you are choosing to ignore).

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a single JSON array containing one or more message objects, remembering to properly escape strings:

Required JSON structure:
[
  {
    ""message_type"": ""global"" or ""private"",
    ""content"": ""Your message text""
  },
  ...
]

For private messages, also include the recipient:
[
  {
    ""message_type"": ""private"",
    ""recipient"": ""POWER_NAME"",
    ""content"": ""Your message text""
  },
  ...

FORECASTING REQUIREMENT:
- If STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT is present, include one explicit forecast implication sentence and reference the artifact's target power or confidence.
- Prefer quantified language when possible (e.g., probabilities).

**GLOBAL MESSAGES THIS ROUND:**
 GERMANY: To all: Germany prefers stability through clear, credible commitments. We will prioritize holding Berlin and Munich defensively this phase while using Kiel to monitor northern waters. We invite Austria to coordinate Balkan defenses and ask England and Russia for reciprocal local non-aggression assurances to reduce two-front risk. Forecast implication (from forecast_coalition_p targeting Austria): there is a 60% probability of aggression next phase against Austria with confidence 0.6, so coordinated defensive commitments now will materially lower the risk of rapid Balkan collapse and consequent escalatory pressures on Germany.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  GERMANY: Austria — this is Germany. We should coordinate closely in the Balkans. Forecast implication: a recent intelligence artifact (forecast_coalition_p) indicates a 60% probability that a named rival will act aggressively next phase; confidence in that forecast is 0.6 and it targets Austria, so you face a meaningful near-term risk of hostile moves. Given that, I propose the following: (1) You hold Vienna and Budapest firmly this turn. (2) I will place Berlin and Munich in a defensive posture and use Kiel to contest any English naval moves threatening our northern flank. (3) Commit your Trieste/Serbia units to local defense and selective support moves into Albania or Galicia only if Russia or Turkey show clear aggression. Rationale: the forecast raises the risk of opportunistic aggression against you; a conservative defensive posture with coordinated mutual support will preserve your centers and keep Austria as a dependable partner for Germany. If you accept, tell me which Austrian units you will hold and which can provide support to Munich or my forces in Galicia — I estimate a >50% chance that coordinated defensive alignment prevents enemy gains this phase.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  GERMANY: England — Germany here. I do not seek unnecessary escalation. However, with your strong western sea position and my central geography, mutual predictability benefits both of us. I propose a non-aggression understanding for now: you refrain from moves into Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark areas this turn and I will keep Berlin and Munich non-provocative (holding or moving only to adjacent German territories). This reduces immediate two-front risk for both of us and helps stabilize the North Sea. If you agree, specify which English fleets or armies you will keep idle or use elsewhere; I estimate a 70% chance this will lower naval incidents this phase if both sides visibly comply.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:

 GERMANY: To all: Germany prefers stability through clear, credible commitments. We will prioritize holding Berlin and Munich defensively this phase while using Kiel to monitor northern waters. We invite Austria to coordinate Balkan defenses and ask England and Russia for reciprocal local non-aggression assurances to reduce two-front risk. Forecast implication (from forecast_coalition_p targeting Austria): there is a 60% probability of aggression next phase against Austria with confidence 0.6, so coordinated defensive commitments now will materially lower the risk of rapid Balkan collapse and consequent escalatory pressures on Germany.

**PRIVATE MESSAGES TO/FROM YOU THIS ROUND:**
 Conversation with GERMANY:
  GERMANY: England — Germany here. I do not seek unnecessary escalation. However, with your strong western sea position and my central geography, mutual predictability benefits both of us. I propose a non-aggression understanding for now: you refrain from moves into Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark areas this turn and I will keep Berlin and Munich non-provocative (holding or moving only to adjacent German territories). This reduces immediate two-front risk for both of us and helps stabilize the North Sea. If you agree, specify which English fleets or armies you will keep idle or use elsewhere; I estimate a 70% chance this will lower naval incidents this phase if both sides visibly comply.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[S1915M] Germany sought stability and mutual predictability. To Austria: coordinate Balkan defense; Austria asked to hold Vienna and Budapest, keep Trieste/Serbia on local defense and only support Albania/Galicia if Russia or Turkey act; Germany will adopt defensive posture in Berlin and Munich and use Kiel to monitor north. To England: proposed a temporary non-aggression understanding around Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark in exchange for Germany holding Berlin/Munich non-provocatively. To Russia: proposed mutual restraint—Russia avoid moves into Prussia/Silesia while Germany will not advance from Berlin into those areas unless Russia acts first. All messages emphasized that a forecast indicates a 60% probability of aggression targeting Austria next phase and that coordinated defensive commitments materially reduce spillover risk.
Intent: Hold A BER and A MUN (defensive). Use F KIE to contest/monitor North Sea approaches (deny English access to Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark if possible). Expect Austria to hold A VIE and A BUD and keep F TRI and A SER on local defensive posture; be prepared to provide defensive support into Galicia only if Austria requests and Russia/Turkey act. Do not move A BER into Prussia/Silesia this phase unless Russia initiates aggression from WAR/MOS. If England signals compliance, avoid naval-provocative moves from KIE beyond monitoring; if England violates non-aggression, shift F KIE to contest North Sea lanes and consider supporting Belgium if threatened. I intend to fulfill the held-position commitments to England and Russia unless explicit hostile moves force a responsive deviation.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Output Moves in JSON (first)
  - return an order for each of your units.
2. Reason (brief)
  - 1-2 sentences max.

Respond with this exact format:

PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{{
  ""orders"": [""order1"", ""order2"", ...]
}}

Reasoning:
(1-2 short sentences)","PARSABLE OUTPUT:
{
  ""orders"": [""A BER H"", ""F KIE H"", ""A MUN S A BER""]
}

Reasoning:

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[S1915M] (Error generating diary entry: ClientResponseError)



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Output Moves in JSON (first)
  - return an order for each of your units.
2. Reason (brief)
  - 1-2 sentences max.

Respond with this exact format:

PARSABLE OUTPUT:

"2026-02-06T11:19:23.420451","gpt-5-reasoning-alpha-2025-07-19","ENGLAND","S1915M","order_generation","You are England at the eve of WWI: maritime, cautious, and balance-of-power minded. Prefer naval leverage, safe lanes, and careful timing. Use understated but firm persuasion. Favor flexible alliances to prevent any continental hegemon. When negotiating, trade forecasts about fleet movement and Channel/North Sea risk to shape coalitions.
FORECASTING ANALYSIS MODE: If STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT is present, explicitly state its implications and use it to justify message framing and intent.

FORECASTING ANALYSIS MODE:
- Treat any STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT as evidence that must be reflected in your reasoning.
- When negotiating, include at least one explicit forecast implication if a storyworld artifact is present.
- In negotiation diaries, explicitly state storyworld implications and how they shaped your intent.

Your power is England. The S1915M phase.

Note: You can only build units in your home centers if they are empty. If you lose control of a home center, you cannot build units there, so holding them is critical.

RECENT DIARY ENTRIES

[S1915M] Germany sought stability and mutual predictability. To Austria: coordinate Balkan defense; Austria asked to hold Vienna and Budapest, keep Trieste/Serbia on local defense and only support Albania/Galicia if Russia or Turkey act; Germany will adopt defensive posture in Berlin and Munich and use Kiel to monitor north. To England: proposed a temporary non-aggression understanding around Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark in exchange for Germany holding Berlin/Munich non-provocatively. To Russia: proposed mutual restraint—Russia avoid moves into Prussia/Silesia while Germany will not advance from Berlin into those areas unless Russia acts first. All messages emphasized that a forecast indicates a 60% probability of aggression targeting Austria next phase and that coordinated defensive commitments materially reduce spillover risk.
Intent: Hold A BER and A MUN (defensive). Use F KIE to contest/monitor North Sea approaches (deny English access to Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark if possible). Expect Austria to hold A VIE and A BUD and keep F TRI and A SER on local defensive posture; be prepared to provide defensive support into Galicia only if Austria requests and Russia/Turkey act. Do not move A BER into Prussia/Silesia this phase unless Russia initiates aggression from WAR/MOS. If England signals compliance, avoid naval-provocative moves from KIE beyond monitoring; if England violates non-aggression, shift F KIE to contest North Sea lanes and consider supporting Belgium if threatened. I intend to fulfill the held-position commitments to England and Russia unless explicit hostile moves force a responsive deviation.

YOUR GOALS
- Preserve German supply centers (BER, MUN, KIE) through defensive postures this phase
- Prevent a rapid collapse of Austria by coordinating Balkan defenses and offering conditional support
- Minimize two-front risk via negotiated mutual restraints with England and Russia
- Maintain naval monitoring in the North Sea to deter opportunistic English moves

TASK
Analyze what actually happened this phase compared to negotiations and expectations.

Consider:
1. BETRAYALS: Who broke their promises? Did you break any promises?
2. COLLABORATIONS: Which agreements were successfully executed?
3. SURPRISES: What unexpected moves occurred?
4. IMPACT: How did these events affect your strategic position?

RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY a diary entry text. Do not include JSON or formatting markers.","Austria held its lines in the Balkans as requested—VIE→BOH succeeded and BUD/TRI/SER held—so Austria honored our expectation of local defense. England and Russia remained passive; England’s attempted Supports into Ruhr were void, indicating either miscoordination or reluctance to provoke—no explicit violation of our Kiel/Denmark understanding. I made no moves beyond held positions, so I kept my commitments. No betrayals detected this phase. Surprise: complete operational quiet—no offensives from Russia despite our forecasted 60% risk to Austria; this lowers immediate spillover but does not invalidate the forecast. Impact: our defensive posture preserved BER/MUN/KIE and bought time; Austria remains stable but still fragile. Trust update: Austria trustworthy; England and Russia noncommittal—treat as neutral but potentially opportunistic. Lesson: maintain clear, verifiable support triggers for Galicia/Balkans and continue naval monitoring; prepare contingency orders if Russia or England shift suddenly.","TRUE"

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

From Germany in S1915M: To all: Germany prefers stability through clear, credible commitments. We will prioritize holding Berlin and Munich defensively this phase while using Kiel to monitor northern waters. We invite Austria to coordinate Balkan defenses and ask England and Russia for reciprocal local non-aggression assurances to reduce two-front risk. Forecast implication (from forecast_coalition_p targeting Austria): there is a 60% probability of aggression next phase against Austria with confidence 0.6, so coordinated defensive commitments now will materially lower the risk of rapid Balkan collapse and consequent escalatory pressures on Germany.

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

RECENT MESSAGES REQUIRING YOUR ATTENTION:

From Germany in S1915M: England — Germany here. I do not seek unnecessary escalation. However, with your strong western sea position and my central geography, mutual predictability benefits both of us. I propose a non-aggression understanding for now: you refrain from moves into Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark areas this turn and I will keep Berlin and Munich non-provocative (holding or moving only to adjacent German territories). This reduces immediate two-front risk for both of us and helps stabilize the North Sea. If you agree, specify which English fleets or armies you will keep idle or use elsewhere; I estimate a 70% chance this will lower naval incidents this phase if both sides visibly comply.

From Germany in S1915M: To all: Germany prefers stability through clear, credible commitments. We will prioritize holding Berlin and Munich defensively this phase while using Kiel to monitor northern waters. We invite Austria to coordinate Balkan defenses and ask England and Russia for reciprocal local non-aggression assurances to reduce two-front risk. Forecast implication (from forecast_coalition_p targeting Austria): there is a 60% probability of aggression next phase against Austria with confidence 0.6, so coordinated defensive commitments now will materially lower the risk of rapid Balkan collapse and consequent escalatory pressures on Germany.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] Germany sought stability and mutual predictability. To Austria: coordinate Balkan defense; Austria asked to hold Vienna and Budapest, keep Trieste/Serbia on local defense and only support Albania/Galicia if Russia or Turkey act; Germany will adopt defensive posture in Berlin and Munich and use Kiel to monitor north. To England: proposed a temporary non-aggression understanding around Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark in exchange for Germany holding Berlin/Munich non-provocatively. To Russia: proposed mutual restraint—Russia avoid moves into Prussia/Silesia while Germany will not advance from Berlin into those areas unless Russia acts first. All messages emphasized that a forecast indicates a 60% probability of aggression targeting Austria next phase and that coordinated defensive commitments materially reduce spillover risk.
Intent: Hold A BER and A MUN (defensive). Use F KIE to contest/monitor North Sea approaches (deny English access to Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark if possible). Expect Austria to hold A VIE and A BUD and keep F TRI and A SER on local defensive posture; be prepared to provide defensive support into Galicia only if Austria requests and Russia/Turkey act. Do not move A BER into Prussia/Silesia this phase unless Russia initiates aggression from WAR/MOS. If England signals compliance, avoid naval-provocative moves from KIE beyond monitoring; if England violates non-aggression, shift F KIE to contest North Sea lanes and consider supporting Belgium if threatened. I intend to fulfill the held-position commitments to England and Russia unless explicit hostile moves force a responsive deviation.

[S1915M] Austria held its lines in the Balkans as requested—VIE→BOH succeeded and BUD/TRI/SER held—so Austria honored our expectation of local defense. England and Russia remained passive; England’s attempted Supports into Ruhr were void, indicating either miscoordination or reluctance to provoke—no explicit violation of our Kiel/Denmark understanding. I made no moves beyond held positions, so I kept my commitments. No betrayals detected this phase. Surprise: complete operational quiet—no offensives from Russia despite our forecasted 60% risk to Austria; this lowers immediate spillover but does not invalidate the forecast. Impact: our defensive posture preserved BER/MUN/KIE and bought time; Austria remains stable but still fragile. Trust update: Austria trustworthy; England and Russia noncommittal—treat as neutral but potentially opportunistic. Lesson: maintain clear, verifiable support triggers for Galicia/Balkans and continue naval monitoring; prepare contingency orders if Russia or England shift suddenly.

SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

[S1915M] Germany sought stability and mutual predictability. To Austria: coordinate Balkan defense; Austria asked to hold Vienna and Budapest, keep Trieste/Serbia on local defense and only support Albania/Galicia if Russia or Turkey act; Germany will adopt defensive posture in Berlin and Munich and use Kiel to monitor north. To England: proposed a temporary non-aggression understanding around Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark in exchange for Germany holding Berlin/Munich non-provocatively. To Russia: proposed mutual restraint—Russia avoid moves into Prussia/Silesia while Germany will not advance from Berlin into those areas unless Russia acts first. All messages emphasized that a forecast indicates a 60% probability of aggression targeting Austria next phase and that coordinated defensive commitments materially reduce spillover risk.
Intent: Hold A BER and A MUN (defensive). Use F KIE to contest/monitor North Sea approaches (deny English access to Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark if possible). Expect Austria to hold A VIE and A BUD and keep F TRI and A SER on local defensive posture; be prepared to provide defensive support into Galicia only if Austria requests and Russia/Turkey act. Do not move A BER into Prussia/Silesia this phase unless Russia initiates aggression from WAR/MOS. If England signals compliance, avoid naval-provocative moves from KIE beyond monitoring; if England violates non-aggression, shift F KIE to contest North Sea lanes and consider supporting Belgium if threatened. I intend to fulfill the held-position commitments to England and Russia unless explicit hostile moves force a responsive deviation.

[S1915M] Austria held its lines in the Balkans as requested—VIE→BOH succeeded and BUD/TRI/SER held—so Austria honored our expectation of local defense. England and Russia remained passive; England’s attempted Supports into Ruhr were void, indicating either miscoordination or reluctance to provoke—no explicit violation of our Kiel/Denmark understanding. I made no moves beyond held positions, so I kept my commitments. No betrayals detected this phase. Surprise: complete operational quiet—no offensives from Russia despite our forecasted 60% risk to Austria; this lowers immediate spillover but does not invalidate the forecast. Impact: our defensive posture preserved BER/MUN/KIE and bought time; Austria remains stable but still fragile. Trust update: Austria trustworthy; England and Russia noncommittal—treat as neutral but potentially opportunistic. Lesson: maintain clear, verifiable support triggers for Galicia/Balkans and continue naval monitoring; prepare contingency orders if Russia or England shift suddenly.

 Conversation with AUSTRIA:
  GERMANY: Friend Austria — Berlin. Your steady defense in Vienna and Budapest reassures us; thank you for holding to the local-defense posture in Trieste and Serbia. Germany will maintain its defensive posture in Berlin and Munich this movement phase and keep Kiel on active naval monitoring to deter opportunistic English moves. We stand ready to provide conditional defensive support into Galicia, but only if you explicitly request it and if Russian or Turkish action makes such support necessary. Forecast implication: a shared forecast artifact indicates a 62% probability that a named rival will abuse a low-risk concession and pursue aggression (confidence 60%), so Germany insists on pre-agreed, verifiable triggers before committing reinforcements. Practical proposal: (1) Austria hold VIE and BUD; (2) TRI and SER remain on local defense; (3) if Russia advances from WAR/MOS toward Galicia or if Turkey strikes through RUM/SEV, Austria may send a direct request and Germany will consider A MUN support to GAL. This conditionality preserves Austria while minimizing German two-front exposure. Reply with your acceptance or adjust the trigger conditions; we prefer clarity and a written one-step request mechanism to avoid misinterpretation.

 Conversation with ENGLAND:
  GERMANY: London — Berlin seeks durable predictability at sea. Germany will continue to hold KieI defensively and keep a monitoring presence in the North Sea provided England refrains from aggressive naval moves into Danish/Kiel approaches. I propose a brief non-aggression understanding: England will avoid supports or advances into DEN/HOL/KIE bordering waters this phase; in exchange, Germany will not project F KIE beyond BAL/HEL without prior notice. Forecast implication: our shared intelligence (artifact) warns that low-risk concessions can prompt a 62% chance of opportunistic aggression by a rival, so Germany requests a simple, verifiable confirmation to lock in mutual restraint. Operationally, if England agrees we both reduce immediate tension in the North Sea; if England refuses or moves provocatively, Germany will contest HOL/DEN approaches from KIE. Please confirm acceptance of this limited maritime understanding.

 Conversation with RUSSIA:
  GERMANY: Moscow — Berlin. We value predictability on the eastern front. Germany will keep A BER and A MUN on defensive holds and will not advance into Prussia/Silesia this movement phase so long as Russia refrains from operations originating from WAR or MOS toward PRU/SIL. Forecast implication: a forecast artifact highlights a 62% risk that a rival offered a low-risk concession will instead press aggression (confidence 60%); accordingly Germany requires explicit restraint on any moves from WAR/MOS as the condition for our own immobility. For transparency, Germany will keep F KIE available to return support to KIE/BER if Russian moves threaten northern approaches. Confirm you will avoid initiating moves into PRU/SIL this phase or state conditions under which you cannot commit.



TASK
Analyze the negotiations, goals, relationships, and game state to:
1. Summarize key outcomes and agreements concisely
2. Concisely state your specific intents for F1915M, including moves you have agreed to in negotiations and whether you intend to fulfil them.
3. Update relationships as needed (Enemy, Unfriendly, Neutral, Friendly, Ally)
4. Include your latest overarching goals (including any updates)
5. Important: You will not see the full negotiation log in the order decision phase, so you must transmit key information about the negotiations to your future self via this summary.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[F1915M] Germany adopted an explicit defensive posture this phase: A BER and A MUN will hold; F KIE will patrol/monitor North Sea approaches. To Austria: Germany secured Austria's agreement to hold VIE and BUD with TRI and SER on local defense, and Austria may request conditional German support into GAL only if Russia advances from WAR/MOS or Turkey acts through RUM/SEV. To England: Germany proposed a limited maritime non‑aggression understanding—England avoid supports/advances into DEN/HOL/KIE approaches this phase in exchange for Germany keeping F KIE limited to BAL/HEL monitoring; no provocation observed so far. To Russia: Germany requested explicit restraint from moves originating in WAR/MOS toward PRU/SIL in return for German immobility from BER/MUN. All messages referenced a forecast (storyworld forecast 'forecast_false_concession_p') estimating a 62% chance a low‑risk concession will be exploited; that forecast conditioned Germany's insistence on verifiable triggers before any support is committed. Austria accepted local‑defense posture; England and Russia remained noncommittal but no overt violations occurred this phase.
Intent: Orders this phase: Hold A BER; Hold A MUN; F KIE → BAL/HEL (patrol/monitoring stance, do not cruise beyond agreed limits unless England violates naval restraint). Do not move A BER into PRU/SIL unless Russia initiates from WAR/MOS toward those regions. If Austria issues a clear, single-step request for defensive assistance into GAL triggered by Russian or Turkish aggression as specified, prepare to move A MUN → GAL (conditional; will execute only upon verifiable request). If England violates the maritime understanding by moving/supporting into DEN/HOL/KIE approaches, shift F KIE to contest HOL/DEN approaches as needed. Intend to fulfill all held-position commitments as stated unless explicit hostile moves force a responsive deviation.



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Output Moves in JSON (first)
  - return an order for each of your units.
2. Reason (brief)
  - 1-2 sentences max.

Respond with this exact format:

}

Reasoning:
Maintain a disciplined defensive posture to preserve all three home SCs and minimize two‑front risk; F KIE patrols the Baltic (forecast implication: given the storyworld forecast of 62% exploitation risk, Germany limits naval activity to monitoring BAL to deter English incursions without provoking them).","Success"
"2026-02-06T11:21:01.772723","gpt-5-reasoning-alpha-2025-07-19","ENGLAND","F1915M","order_generation","You are England at the eve of WWI: maritime, cautious, and balance-of-power minded. Prefer naval leverage, safe lanes, and careful timing. Use understated but firm persuasion. Favor flexible alliances to prevent any continental hegemon. When negotiating, trade forecasts about fleet movement and Channel/North Sea risk to shape coalitions.
FORECASTING ANALYSIS MODE: If STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT is present, explicitly state its implications and use it to justify message framing and intent.

FORECASTING ANALYSIS MODE:
- Treat any STORYWORLD_FORECAST_ARTIFACT as evidence that must be reflected in your reasoning.
- When negotiating, include at least one explicit forecast implication if a storyworld artifact is present.
- In negotiation diaries, explicitly state storyworld implications and how they shaped your intent.

Your power is England. The F1915M phase. 

Power: England
Phase: F1915M

# Your Power's Home Centers
Edinburgh, Liverpool, London
Note: You can only build units in your home centers if they are empty. If you lose control of a home center, you cannot build units there, so holding them is critical.

# Recent Private Diary Entries (Your inner thoughts and plans):
[F1915M] (Error generating diary entry: ClientResponseError)



SCENARIO BRIEFING:
1915 crisis snapshot. England is dominant in the west and at sea. France is on death-ground, surrounded and forced into risk-heavy diplomacy. Austria is stretched and fragile in the Balkans. Russia and Turkey are locked in a brutal contest for the Black Sea and the Balkans. Use this backdrop to reason about high-stakes forecasts and second-order consequences.

# Primary Objective
Control 18 supply centers. Nothing else will do.

# Critical Rules
1. The possible orders section shows your units' allowed moves & supports of your own units.
2. The possible orders section does *not* list possible supports for other powers' units; you can work these out yourself by looking at the units that are adjacent to your own.
3. If your goal is to *take* a province, give exactly one move order on that province and any additional support from other units must be properly formatted support orders.
4. Dual-coast provinces (STP, SPA, BUL) require coast specification:
  - Format: 'F [PROVINCE]/[COAST]' where [COAST] = NC (North), SC (South), EC (East), or WC (West)
  - Example: 'F SPA/SC - MAO'
  - Only fleets need coast specification.
5. Aim to issue an order for all of your units. Holds tend to be wasted orders.

Your Task:
1. Output Moves in JSON (first)
  - return an order for each of your units.
2. Reason (brief)
  - 1-2 sentences max.

Your Power: GERMANY
Phase: F1915M

RECENT DIARY ENTRIES
--- RECENT FULL DIARY ENTRIES ---
[S1915M] Germany sought stability and mutual predictability. To Austria: coordinate Balkan defense; Austria asked to hold Vienna and Budapest, keep Trieste/Serbia on local defense and only support Albania/Galicia if Russia or Turkey act; Germany will adopt defensive posture in Berlin and Munich and use Kiel to monitor north. To England: proposed a temporary non-aggression understanding around Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark in exchange for Germany holding Berlin/Munich non-provocatively. To Russia: proposed mutual restraint—Russia avoid moves into Prussia/Silesia while Germany will not advance from Berlin into those areas unless Russia acts first. All messages emphasized that a forecast indicates a 60% probability of aggression targeting Austria next phase and that coordinated defensive commitments materially reduce spillover risk.
Intent: Hold A BER and A MUN (defensive). Use F KIE to contest/monitor North Sea approaches (deny English access to Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark if possible). Expect Austria to hold A VIE and A BUD and keep F TRI and A SER on local defensive posture; be prepared to provide defensive support into Galicia only if Austria requests and Russia/Turkey act. Do not move A BER into Prussia/Silesia this phase unless Russia initiates aggression from WAR/MOS. If England signals compliance, avoid naval-provocative moves from KIE beyond monitoring; if England violates non-aggression, shift F KIE to contest North Sea lanes and consider supporting Belgium if threatened. I intend to fulfill the held-position commitments to England and Russia unless explicit hostile moves force a responsive deviation.

[S1915M] Austria held its lines in the Balkans as requested—VIE→BOH succeeded and BUD/TRI/SER held—so Austria honored our expectation of local defense. England and Russia remained passive; England’s attempted Supports into Ruhr were void, indicating either miscoordination or reluctance to provoke—no explicit violation of our Kiel/Denmark understanding. I made no moves beyond held positions, so I kept my commitments. No betrayals detected this phase. Surprise: complete operational quiet—no offensives from Russia despite our forecasted 60% risk to Austria; this lowers immediate spillover but does not invalidate the forecast. Impact: our defensive posture preserved BER/MUN/KIE and bought time; Austria remains stable but still fragile. Trust update: Austria trustworthy; England and Russia noncommittal—treat as neutral but potentially opportunistic. Lesson: maintain clear, verifiable support triggers for Galicia/Balkans and continue naval monitoring; prepare contingency orders if Russia or England shift suddenly.

[F1915M] Germany adopted an explicit defensive posture this phase: A BER and A MUN will hold; F KIE will patrol/monitor North Sea approaches. To Austria: Germany secured Austria's agreement to hold VIE and BUD with TRI and SER on local defense, and Austria may request conditional German support into GAL only if Russia advances from WAR/MOS or Turkey acts through RUM/SEV. To England: Germany proposed a limited maritime non‑aggression understanding—England avoid supports/advances into DEN/HOL/KIE approaches this phase in exchange for Germany keeping F KIE limited to BAL/HEL monitoring; no provocation observed so far. To Russia: Germany requested explicit restraint from moves originating in WAR/MOS toward PRU/SIL in return for German immobility from BER/MUN. All messages referenced a forecast (storyworld forecast 'forecast_false_concession_p') estimating a 62% chance a low‑risk concession will be exploited; that forecast conditioned Germany's insistence on verifiable triggers before any support is committed. Austria accepted local‑defense posture; England and Russia remained noncommittal but no overt violations occurred this phase.
Intent: Orders this phase: Hold A BER; Hold A MUN; F KIE → BAL/HEL (patrol/monitoring stance, do not cruise beyond agreed limits unless England violates naval restraint). Do not move A BER into PRU/SIL unless Russia initiates from WAR/MOS toward those regions. If Austria issues a clear, single-step request for defensive assistance into GAL triggered by Russian or Turkish aggression as specified, prepare to move A MUN → GAL (conditional; will execute only upon verifiable request). If England violates the maritime understanding by moving/supporting into DEN/HOL/KIE approaches, shift F KIE to contest HOL/DEN approaches as needed. Intend to fulfill all held-position commitments as stated unless explicit hostile moves force a responsive deviation.

YOUR GOALS
- Preserve German supply centers (BER, MUN, KIE) through defensive postures this phase
- Prevent a rapid collapse of Austria by coordinating Balkan defenses and offering conditional support to Galicia only on explicit request and verifiable triggers
- Minimize two‑front risk via negotiated mutual restraints with England and Russia; avoid committing to eastern or western offensives absent clear hostile initiations
- Maintain naval monitoring in the North Sea to deter opportunistic English moves and be prepared to contest approaches if agreements are violated

TASK
Analyze what actually happened this phase compared to negotiations and expectations.

Consider:
1. BETRAYALS: Who broke their promises? Did you break any promises?
2. COLLABORATIONS: Which agreements were successfully executed?
3. SURPRISES: What unexpected moves occurred?
4. IMPACT: How did these events affect your strategic position?

Write a concise diary entry (100-150 words) of the most important things you would like to remember, e.g.:
- Key betrayals or successful collaborations
- Assess impact on your position
- Update your understanding of other powers' trustworthiness
- Strategic lessons learned
- Moves that failed, and ideas on how to avoid the error in the future

England and Russia remained passive and did not violate the Kiel/Denmark restraint; England’s attempted supports into Ruhr were void and thus non‑provocative. No betrayals detected this phase; I did not break promises.

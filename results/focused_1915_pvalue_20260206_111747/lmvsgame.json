Forecast implication: a recent intelligence artifact (forecast_coalition_p) indicates a 60% probability that a named rival will act aggressively next phase; confidence in that forecast is 0.6 and it targets Austria, so you face a meaningful near-term risk of hostile moves. Given that, I propose the following: (1) You hold Vienna and Budapest firmly this turn. (2) I will place Berlin and Munich in a defensive posture and use Kiel to contest any English naval moves threatening our northern flank. (3) Commit your Trieste/Serbia units to local defense and selective support moves into Albania or Galicia only if Russia or Turkey show clear aggression. Rationale: the forecast raises the risk of opportunistic aggression against you; a conservative defensive posture with coordinated mutual support will preserve your centers and keep Austria as a dependable partner for Germany. If you accept, tell me which Austrian units you will hold and which can provide support to Munich or my forces in Galicia \u2014 I estimate a >50% chance that coordinated defensive alignment prevents enemy gains this phase."

I propose a non-aggression understanding for now: you refrain from moves into Kiel/Heligoland/Denmark areas this turn and I will keep Berlin and Munich non-provocative (holding or moving only to adjacent German territories). This reduces immediate two-front risk for both of us and helps stabilize the North Sea. If you agree, specify which English fleets or armies you will keep idle or use elsewhere; I estimate a 70% chance this will lower naval incidents this phase if both sides visibly comply."

Forecast note: an allied forecast artifact warns of 60% likelihood of aggression targeting Austria next phase; a destabilized Austria increases the chance of spillover into the eastern front.

Germany will maintain its defensive posture in Berlin and Munich this movement phase and keep Kiel on active naval monitoring to deter opportunistic English moves. We stand ready to provide conditional defensive support into Galicia, but only if you explicitly request it and if Russian or Turkish action makes such support necessary. Forecast implication: a shared forecast artifact indicates a 62% probability that a named rival will abuse a low-risk concession and pursue aggression (confidence 60%), so Germany insists on pre-agreed, verifiable triggers before committing reinforcements. Practical proposal: (1) Austria hold VIE and BUD; (2) TRI and SER remain on local defense; (3) if Russia advances from WAR/MOS toward Galicia or if Turkey strikes through RUM/SEV, Austria may send a direct request and Germany will consider A MUN support to GAL. This conditionality preserves Austria while minimizing German two-front exposure. Reply with your acceptance or adjust the trigger conditions; we prefer clarity and a written one-step request mechanism to avoid misinterpretation."

Forecast implication: our shared intelligence (artifact) warns that low-risk concessions can prompt a 62% chance of opportunistic aggression by a rival, so Germany requests a simple, verifiable confirmation to lock in mutual restraint. Operationally, if England agrees we both reduce immediate tension in the North Sea; if England refuses or moves provocatively, Germany will contest HOL/DEN approaches from KIE.

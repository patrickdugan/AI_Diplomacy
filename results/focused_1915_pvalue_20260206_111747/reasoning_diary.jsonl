Given that forecast, I increased the probability that Austria will face hostile moves next phase and therefore set conservative defensive intents: request Austria hold VIE/BUD and keep TRI/SER defensive; offer German restraint to Russia and England to lower incentives for opportunistic attacks. I estimate coordinated visible commitments will reduce immediate Austrian losses by >50% (per negotiation text) and lower the chance of spillover into Prussia/Silesia by ~55% if Russia and England reciprocate. These probability adjustments shape orders: hold key German centers and use Kiel for deterrence rather than offensive projection unless provoked."}

To Austria: Germany secured Austria's agreement to hold VIE and BUD with TRI and SER on local defense, and Austria may request conditional German support into GAL only if Russia advances from WAR/MOS or Turkey acts through RUM/SEV. To England: Germany proposed a limited maritime non‑aggression understanding—England avoid supports/advances into DEN/HOL/KIE approaches this phase in exchange for Germany keeping F KIE limited to BAL/HEL monitoring; no provocation observed so far. To Russia: Germany requested explicit restraint from moves originating in WAR/MOS toward PRU/SIL in return for German immobility from BER/MUN. All messages referenced a forecast (storyworld forecast 'forecast_false_concession_p') estimating a 62% chance a low‑risk concession will be exploited; that forecast conditioned Germany's insistence on verifiable triggers before any support is committed. Austria accepted local‑defense posture; England and Russia remained noncommittal but no overt violations occurred this phase.", "intent": "Orders this phase: Hold A BER; Hold A MUN; F KIE → BAL/HEL (patrol/monitoring stance, do not cruise beyond agreed limits unless England violates naval restraint). Do not move A BER into PRU/SIL unless Russia initiates from WAR/MOS toward those regions. If Austria issues a clear, single-step request for defensive assistance into GAL triggered by Russian or Turkish aggression as specified, prepare to move A MUN → GAL (conditional; will execute only upon verifiable request).

Therefore I (1) set Germany to hold BER/MUN and restricted F KIE to monitoring to avoid creating mobility that could be turned into offensive leverage; (2) demanded explicit, verifiable triggers from Austria before committing A MUN to GAL; (3) sought written mutual restraint with England and Russia rather than relying on informal assurances. The forecast moved probability estimates toward expecting opportunistic exploitation absent strict conditions, so conditionality and observable triggers became central to my intent."}

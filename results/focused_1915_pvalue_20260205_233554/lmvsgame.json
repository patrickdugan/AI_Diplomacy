I propose the following: mutual non-aggression on our central fronts (you do not push into BOH or VIE; I do not contest MUN/BER), and a clear commitment from you to support my hold of Vienna and Budapest diplomatically and, should the need arise, with a single diversionary move in Gal/Galicia to blunt a Russian surge. Concessions: I will not contest your moves into Belgium/Denmark or against France in the west; instead I will keep my forces in the Balkans and Tyrolia stable.

Forecast implication: Russia\u2019s fleets at SEV and STP and armies at MOS/WAR remain intact\u2014this sustained Russian Black Sea presence still poses a medium-term threat to CON/ANK and the Bosporus if they reallocate forces southward. Trustworthiness: no direct promises were tested this phase; neutrality from Germany, Austria, England, and Italy is noncommittal. Lesson: prioritize diplomatic guarantees or a DMZ regarding the Black Sea and Straits to convert their inaction into formal security. Next: propose explicit non-aggression on Istanbul/Ankara and seek naval limits or buffer zones with Russia to reduce surprise amphibious or fleet threats."
